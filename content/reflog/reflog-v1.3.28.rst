Welcome to the second edition of **The GitHub Reflog**. This is a
new weekly chronicle of remarkable GitHub repos. For previous
articles, check out
`The Reflog Archive <https://github.com/kennethreitz/github-reflog>`_.

Featured Repo of the Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`koggdal/ocanvas <https://github.com/koggdal/ocanvas>`_

oCanvas is a middle layer for generating Canvas regions. Instead of
dealing directly with pixels, you manage a set of display objects.
oCanvas provides an elegant API and full event system for
manipulating these objects, performing all the hard work in the
background. From there you can create, manipulate, and animate to
your heart's content.

Check out the polished `demo page <http://ocanvas.org/>`_ to see it
in action.

Remarkable Repos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


-  `evanphx/gx <https://github.com/evanphx/gx>`_: Gx is a Git
   tool that assists in merge conflict resolution. If you're using Git
   properly these are hard to come by, but every once in a while, a
   merge conflict is unavoidable. Git's merge resolution interface is
   a little difficult to deal with sometimes, so Gx gives you a simple
   interface for handling those conflicts.

-  `BigZaphod/Chameleon <https://github.com/BigZaphod/Chameleon>`_:
   This project's massive undertaking is to replicate Apple's
   `UIKit <http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIKit_Framework/_index.html>`_,
   used extensively for writing iOS apps, for OSX. It's an cleanroom
   implementation that mirrors the API exactly. The project is
   currently 9 months in development has about 60% UIKit coverage.
   Chameleon's best feature is that it allows you to build apps that
   target both iOS and OSX with the same codebase. If you're
   developing OSX applications, this is definitely with taking a look
   at.

-  `jugyo/earthquake <https://github.com/jugyo/earthquake>`_:
   This is an awesome new Twitter client for your terminal. Written in
   Ruby, Earthquake features proper OAuth authentication, streaming
   support, terminal colors, and tab completion. It appears to have
   been implemented specifically for the recent earthquakes in Japan.
   It's always great to see the open source community continuously
   `stepping up <https://github.com/brendanlim/Tradui>`_ to assist in
   times of need.

-  `twigkit/tempo <https://github.com/twigkit/tempo>`_: Tempo
   is zero-dependency JavaScript template engine built on top of
   old-fashioned HTML. It's designed to make rendering of JSON content
   as simple as possible. It currently features nested data support,
   boolean conditionals, and gracefully falls back if JavaScript isn't
   available.


Promising Repos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


-  `shinh/maloader <https://github.com/shinh/maloader>`_: This
   project looks very promising. It's a x86-64 Mach-O executable
   loader for Linux. It can run most of the Xcode toolchain from
   Linux. It can currently run Xcode's gcc-4.2, otool, dyldinfo,
   dwarfdump, cpp-4.2, dsymutil, and others. Maloader plans to support
   commandline applications only at this time.

-  `antimatter15/player <https://github.com/antimatter15/player>`_:
   This unique MP3 player is an excellent showcase of HTML5's
   capabilities. Point it to a folder on your system, and it
   recursively finds MP3 files, parses the ID3 tag metadata, and plays
   them from the browser. Check out
   `the demo <http://antimatter15.github.com/player/player.html>`_ to
   give it a try!
