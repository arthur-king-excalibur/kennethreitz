Community Update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last week, Apple's `MacRuby <https://github.com/MacRuby/>`_ project
began to officially migrate to GitHub for its development. This
week, the `Eclipse Foundation <https://github.com/eclipse/>`_ and
the `Glasgow Haskell Compiler <https://github.com/ghc/>`_ both
created official GitHub mirrors. GHC even accepts pull requests!

Welcome, guys!

Featured Repo of the Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`divegeek/uscode <https://github.com/divegeek/uscode>`_

This small project from Shawn Willden is simple, but ambitious. It
is a repository that contains a complete, up-to-date version of the
United States Code, in the most hacker-friendly format possible:
version-controlled plaintext. The repo is updated regularly with
official modifications from the US Federal Government websites.
Curious to see what modifications were made? Run ``git diff``.

The purpose of this repo is explore new ideas related to the
legislation process in the digital age. Check out
`the readme <https://github.com/divegeek/uscode#readme>`_ to learn
more.

Remarkable Repos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


-  `dotcloud/cloudlets <https://github.com/dotcloud/cloudlets>`_:
   This project is awesome. It's a tool for creating small, universal
   server images under version control. The resulting images can be
   exported to "any bootable format known to man" for deployment in
   virtually any environment. Formats include: Xen, KVM, EC2 AMI,
   Tarballs, and ol' fashioned bootable CDs. Soon, cloudlets will
   offer support for full VM generation (vmkdk, xen, and qemu) and
   multi-image stacks. If you're looking to create turn-key server
   images for your application or platform, this is a great place to
   start.

-  `josevalim/elixir <https://github.com/josevalim/elixir>`_:
   This is a functional language runtime built on top of Erlang. It
   provides object orientation, a Ruby-esque syntax, and can
   interoperate seamlessly with standard Erlang code and datatypes.
   The project is still under development, but already has a large
   contributor and user base. If you'd like to assist in its
   development, checkout the
   `project roadmap <https://github.com/josevalim/elixir/blob/master/ROADMAP.md>`_
   and send a pull request.

-  `ilektrojohn/creepy <https://github.com/ilektrojohn/creepy>`_:
   Ever wonder what personal data is floating around the web for the
   world to see? Checkout creepy. Point it to all of your social
   network accounts, and it displays a map filled with your past
   locations. Data is fetched from a number of social APIs and photo
   services. It even goes as far as to parse Geo-location tags from
   uploaded image EXIF data. Creepy!

-  `jordansissel/fpm <https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm>`_:
   This is an interesting project. FPM, "Effing Package Management",
   takes out all the headaches of creating ``.deb`` and ``.rpm``
   packages for your own consumption. It allows you to distribute your
   application in any style and configuration you want, abandoning all
   distro-specific best practices. The author designed it to be as
   simple as possible: "Here's my install dir and here are some
   dependencies; please make a package". This may or may not be a good
   idea. Give it a try and decide for yourself :)


Promising Repos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


-  `javisantana/whitebrd.me <https://github.com/javisantana/whitebrd.me>`_:
   This brand new project looks very promising. It's a webapp that
   provides realtime collaborative sketching. It's essentially
   Etherpad but for simple drawings. To try it out, open up
   `The Official GitHub Reflog Whiteboard™ <http://whitebrd.me/board/6734c820-5eb8-11e0-b7ba-4040510841d9>`_
   and start sketching!

-  `atomicobject/objection <https://github.com/atomicobject/objection>`_:
   This is an MIT licensed dependency injection framework for iOS and
   OSX ObjectiveC applications. It strives to be as lightweight, yet
   flexible, as possible. The project is still fairly young and has a
   small todo list, so forks are encouraged.

-  `mikeal/spider <https://github.com/mikeal/spider>`_: This
   `node.js <https://github.com/joyent/node>`_ project is a simple
   programmatic web spider, powered by jQuery. It has a very small
   code base (~200 SLOC), yet offers custom user agent strings,
   connection pools, and memory cache.
