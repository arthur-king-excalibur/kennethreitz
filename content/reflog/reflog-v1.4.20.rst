GitHub Reflog v1.4.20
=====================

:date: 2011-04-20 19:03
:category: github, code

Welcome to the **The GitHub Reflog** â€” the weekly chronicle of
remarkable GitHub repos and community activity. For previous
editions, check out
`The Reflog Archive <https://github.com/kennethreitz/github-reflog>`_.

This week, we welcome Python's
`simplejson <https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson/>`_ module
and *The Joy of Clojure*
`code examples <https://github.com/joyofclojure/book-source>`_ to
GitHub!

Featured Repo of the Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`maccman/spine <https://github.com/maccman/spine>`_

    Spine is a micro MVC framework for building JavaScript
    applications. While similar in concept to
    `Backbone.js <https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone>`_, Spine
    contains some key differences. It offers class inheritance,
    controllers, a model system with a full ORM, and HTML5 local
    storage support.

    Spine comes with demo
    `todo system <https://github.com/maccman/spine.todos>`_ and
    `contact manager <https://github.com/maccman/spine.contacts>`_
    applications to give you a feel of its capabilities. It currently
    powers the JavaScript for the open source campfire-esque
    `Holla <https://github.com/maccman/holla>`_ project.

Awesome Repo of the Week
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`aarongough/flea <https://github.com/aarongough/flea>`_

    Flea is a mini Lisp interpreter written in Ruby, inspired by
    portions of Scheme. Obviously, this isn't designed to be used in
    production for any reason. The purpose of the project is to simply
    showcase the versatility of dynamic languages like Ruby.

    Run ``$ gem install flea`` to give it a spin.

Remarkable Repos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


-  `anchepiece/statuspanic <https://github.com/anchepiece/statuspanic>`_:
   A clone of Panic's infamous
   `Status Board <http://www.panic.com/blog/2010/03/the-panic-status-board/>`_,
   powered by PHP. It features bar charts, weather widgets, and a
   countdown timer. Head over to the
   `example installation <http://allynbauer.com/software/statuspanic/>`_
   to see it in action.

-  `hanwen/go-fuse <https://github.com/hanwen/go-fuse>`_:
   Native FUSE bindings for the Go programming language. Go-fuse
   strives to be as fast as possible. Support for individual
   filesystems isn't included (at this time), but example
   implementations of zipfs and unionfs are.

-  `gmarik/vundle <https://github.com/gmarik/vundle>`_: A true
   plugin manager for VIM. Inspired by the ever popular
   `pathogen <https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen>`_ for VIM and
   `bundler <https://github.com/carlhuda/bundler>`_ for Ruby, Vundle
   gives you the ability to search, install, update, and configure
   your scripts, all from interactive mode.


Promising Repos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


-  `boxedice/python-daemon <https://github.com/boxedice/python-daemon>`_:
   A simple Python daemonizer class. This project allows your Python
   application to continue running in the background as a daemon.
   Features include scheduling, a standard PID file interface, and
   support for Unix, Linux and OS X.

-  `88mph/wpadmin <https://github.com/88mph/wpadmin>`_: Command
   line tool for WordPress administration, written in PHP. Currently,
   it can manage user accounts and configuration values. In the near
   future, you'll also be able to publish posts and pages right from
   your terminal. There's a small todo list, so pull requests are
   welcome!

-  `disqus/mule <https://github.com/disqus/mule>`_: A full
   distributed test runner framework for Python, powered by Celery.
   Beware, it's undergoing heavy development and is far from stable.
   When it's ready, it will include out of the box support for xunit,
   multiprocessing, and unittest2.

-  `seppo0010/redislite <https://github.com/seppo0010/redislite>`_:
   SQLite-style local database for Redis instead of SQL. This BSD
   licensed project is is still in its early stages, but will be
   extremely useful once it is complete. Definitely keep your eye on
   it.

-  `dbyrne/4clojure <https://github.com/dbyrne/4clojure>`_: An
   interactive tutorial website for beginners learning Clojure
   (similar to
   `Try Redis <https://github.com/alexmchale/try.redis>`_). There's a
   bit of work to be done still, so check out the
   `issues page <https://github.com/dbyrne/4clojure/issues>`_ for ways
   to help.
