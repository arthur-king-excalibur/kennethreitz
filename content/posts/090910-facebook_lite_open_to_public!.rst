It's official, `Facebook Lite <http://lite.facebook.com>`_ was
opened up to the US public about 10 minutes ago.

This slimmed down version of Facebook is wonderful for those of us
on slow internet connections (or tethering from our iPhones), this
is a dream come true.

Reminds me of the good ol' days, when I had to go to
http://gmu.facebook.com to see my facebook friends.

Here you can see it in action:
