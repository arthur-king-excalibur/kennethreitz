Well, I'm thinking of doing a series of video posts. This seems to
work pretty well for some people.
I'm looking for some good topic ideas.

**Ideas so far:** - Gadget Reviews - Emotional posts that just
can't be captured by words - In general thoughts on the tech world

I'll see what I can do about posting one this week.
