While listening to this week's episode of
`The Changelog <http://thechangelog.com>`_, I came across Tom
Preston-Werner's
`Semantic Versioning Specification <http://semver.org/>`_. I love
what I found. For many years, the open source community has been
plagued with version number dystonia. Numbers vary so greatly from
project to project, they are practically meaningless. This
specification seeks to put an end to this madness with a small set
of practical guidelines for you and your colleagues to use in your
next project. Included is a helpful guideline for correlating
repository tagging. In good taste, Mojombo also opened up the
website. If you'd like to contribute to the site, just fork the
repository, make your changes, and send a pull request. The way it
should be. [`Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_]
