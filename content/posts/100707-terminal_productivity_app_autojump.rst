On average, I'd say I spend 65% of the workday in a terminal
session. About 95% of that time is within the same same 4
directories. ``cd foo`` & ``cd bar`` can get old. **AutoJump**
is a "cd command that learns". It tracks shell history to detect
which directories you spend the most time in, and allows you to
*jump* to them without any directory context. It even supports
Zsh tab completion. :)

From this::

    cd /Users/kreitz/repos/public/gistapi\

To this::

    j gistapi


Life is good.
