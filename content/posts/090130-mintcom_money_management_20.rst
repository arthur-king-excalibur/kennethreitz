There are a few things in life that I am naturally not good at.
Some people fail at communication skills, while others
`get angry and lash out at others for no reason <http://jwhsband.tripod.com/>`_.
I, however, like to spend all of my money. ALL of it. Every
paycheck.

But thanks to this lovely website, that is going to stop now:
`mint.com <http://www.mint.com>`_.

Mint is an online budgeting and expense tracking system, which
links to your bank account, credit cards, investments, and loan
agencies. It's truly amazing what a little web 2.0 site like that
can do to change things around for you. I'm now saving my money and
actually following a budget! Whenever I go over budget in a certain
category, Mint notifies me immediately (via text message or email)
of the indescrepency. And best of all, It shows me a pretty
flow-chart of what I spend all my money on! Data presentation is
such a powerful tool.

I spend $53 a month on McDonalds? I had no idea!

So, come on! Go to `Mint.com <http://www.mint.com>`_! Give it a
try! You might save a few bucks (or, like me, a few pounds!).
