Trey of lopsa.org wrote a
`fantastic article <http://lopsa.org/node/1566>`_ on the the techie
vs. non-techie divide. If you are in the user-interface market, I
suggest you read this. It sheds some wonderful light on this great
divide. ## In Short Ordinary Users only see and understand content
in a system. Developers and Techies implicitly understand the
Metadata that surrounds that content at such an intimate level that
they build systems that subconsciously further the divide. Good
Stuff.
