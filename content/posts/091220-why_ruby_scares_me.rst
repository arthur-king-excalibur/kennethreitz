Ruby scares me. It's not the language that strikes fear in my
heart, however; it is the community. |image| ## The Reasons 1. They
treat Ruby as the Messiah — there is nothing better. There is
nothing else. Only Ruby. 2. Community Leader Idol Wordship — did
anyone catch the (online presence) death of
`\_why <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff>`_? 3.
"Now we can finally get things done". — See next question. 4. Have
you ever seen Ruby code? Look at below. 5. See Reason # 4. def
remember(&a\_block) @block = a\_block end

::

    remember {|name| puts "Hello, #{name}!"}
    
    @block.call("Jon")
    # => "Hello, Jon!"

Can you really tell me, with a degree of certainty, what that's
supposed to do? Please, just shoot me now.
