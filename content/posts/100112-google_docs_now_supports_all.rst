For an extra $5 a month, `Evernote <http://evernote.com>`_ lets you
upload a file of any extension to their servers. This is a
fantastic feature for developers who like to keep their random psd
and 3ds files in sync with the cloud. Looks like Google finally
took the hint. Within the next few weeks, they will be rolling out
(in the typical staggered unveiling) the ability to upload up to 1
GB of files to Google Docs. Additional storage space will be $0.25
/ GB / Year. That's one tenth the price of Amazon S3! [
