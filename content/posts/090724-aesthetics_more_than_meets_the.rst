I was doing some routine poking around the
`TextMate Wiki <http://wiki.macromates.com/Main/HomePage>`_
tonight, and I came across an
`amazing mod <http://jason-evers.com/code/code-like-i-do>`_.
Amazing. After installing it, my favorite editor looked brand new,
and I started hacking away at code for hours.

Customized (yet clean) interfaces really help me focus on my work.
Working in an IDE with a black background just feels right to me. I
wasn't nearly as satisfied with my .NET development when using the
default
`Visual Studio color scheme <http://weblogs.asp.net/infinitiesloop/archive/2006/08/06/Join-the-Dark-Side-of-Visual-Studio.aspx>`_.
I found the dark and everything became better. I felt more at home.
I looked at it and it made me smile.

Just a thought.
