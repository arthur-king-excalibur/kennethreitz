`Twitter <http://twitter.com>`_ is by far the market leader of the
so-called "micro-blogging" scene. Is this a bad thing? A number
people think that
`Twitter is destroying us <http://www.neuro-vision.us/ad/Article/How-Twitter-is-Destroying-Your-Mind/4970>`_.
Others seem to find it to be a wonderful
`marketplace <http://www.ehow.com/how_2263342_market-business-twitter.html>`_
and even a source for
`revenue <http://www.whatsyourtweetworth.com/>`_, if allowed. In
order for any of these things to come to realization though,
Twitter must make some serious decisions. And fast. The initial
idea is to value a twitterer's rank based upon the number of
followers a user has. This seems like a good, strong idea for a
while, but when you look a little deeper under the skin, it's
apparent that this is not a good system. Most users send an update
every so often about themselves, their lives, and their homes. What
worth is that? Yes, a message would be delivered to a larger number
of people, but the relevancy of the people being reached would be
very low. However, if one was to write a quality tweet that is
`re-tweeted over and over again <http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/29/its-not-how-many-followers-you-have-that-counts-its-how-many-times-you-get-retweeted/>`_,
that user will reach an even larger group of people, either
directly or in-directly, and the relevancy of the users reached
would be much, much greater. The more people who reTweet what you
have to say not only reach more users than meaningless-tweeters,
but the people who would take the time to listen to what you have
to say would be immensely more common. More relevant readers mean
more clicks, which mean more visits to linked sites, which means
more revenue for a company and even more potential customers. What
do you think?
