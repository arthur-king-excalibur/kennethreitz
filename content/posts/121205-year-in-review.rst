On Heroku and 2012
==================

Alas, 2012 is quickly coming to a close.

This has been an absolutely incredible year — easily the best of the mere twenty-four I've experienced so far. I became a member of the Python Software Foundation, traveled all over the world, met several thousand inspiring software developers, and collaborated on dozens of incredible projects.

It's important to reflect — perspective is everything.

Heroku
------

I officially [joined Heroku](http://kennethreitz.org/joining-heroku.html) exactly one year ago today. It's amazing how time flies.

Heroku is directly responsible for the majority of my satisfaction of the past year. I feel incredibly privileged to work with this fine group of individuals — the most talented, classy, supportive, attentive, and caring group of people I've ever had the pleasure to meet.

Words can't serialize how much I recommend [working at Heroku](). If you are speaking at a conference, Heroku will fully fund your trip. If there's a natural disaster in your area (e.g. Super-Storm Sandy), you will be contacted by a dedicated member of the Vibe team, ensuring your family's safety, accommodation, and well-being.

The strangest part of the Heroku environment is our unlimited vacation policy. My job consists primarily of two things: Making Heroku awesome for Python, and Making Python awesome for Heroku. I took a week off after a six-week world tour last month, but kept finding myself doing what I love to do — my work.

I'm looking forward to many more years with Heroku.

Accomplishments & Goals
-----------------------

For years, I dreamed of being a well known member of the open source community. I spent hundreds of nights obsessing over other's code and developing my own development style and philosophies.

Much to my surprise, all of that work really paid off. Today, I'm the #1 most followed Python GitHub user and the #17th most followed GitHub user in general. Requests has been downloaded 1,500,000+ times and is indirectly helping change the world. OSX-GCC-Installer reached over 43 TB of downloads and directly inspired Apple's Command-Line Tools.

It's humbling to look at those metrics, as vain as they are. It's all about validation.

Traveling the World
-------------------

I've spent the majority of my time this year traveling. It's a bit daunting to think about, honestly:

[Lanyards]

One year ago, I had given only **one talk** in my entire life (PyCodeConf) and didn't even own a passport.

This year:

- 116,933 miles traveled by air (+ dec)
- 138 hotel nights.
- 29 talks given.
- 20 conferences attended.
- 11 meetups attended.
- 8 countries visited.

I rediscovered my deep love for Photography:

And even got the chance to reconnect with friends from past lives:

- Chris Jison (4th-8th Grade, MN)
- Eva Blackmer (9th Grade, MD)
- Tony Southern (10th Grade, MN)

Lessons Learned
---------------

I've leaned a lot during my travels. You have lots of time to reflect and get to know yourself.

Considering being a developer evangelist?

- You'll get lonely.
- You'll meet more people than you can imagine. You won't remember everyone's names. Just ask for a refresher.
- Personal time is essential. Relax and enjoy yourself.
- Your influence and audience is much larger than you think. The majority of your users are unspoken. How often do you reach out to the author of a library you love?
- You'll meet more people than you can possibly imagine
- Window seats are awesome. Anyone who disagrees has no soul.
- Less is more. I've optimized my travel kit to a single small backpack.

I spent most of my life moving around the country. Between 8th and 10th grade, I attended **seven** different schools. Being out of my element is my element.

Personal Values
---------------

In closing, I'll leave myself with a short list of my personal values. They haven't changed much over the years. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.

- Life's not a race, but there's no speed limit either.
- Positivity. Negative atmospheres are toxic. Remove yourself from them.
- Fallibilism & Open Mindedness. There is only one thing I can be certain of in life: that I am prone to error. Nothing saddens me more than someone who is unwilling to listen to others.
- Attention is my only currency. Allocate it sparingly. Don't spend a single moment in life doing something you don't want to do.


Here's to 2013! Hopefully the Mayans based their calendar on the Twinkie.
