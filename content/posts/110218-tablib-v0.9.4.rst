Tablib v0.9.4 was released today.

For those unfamiliar with Tablib, itâ€™s my format-agnostic tabular data library. To learn more, see Tablib.org.

Finally, we have Python 2.5 support! This should open some new possibilities, particularly for those of you on Google App Engine.

This update brings:

    - Python 2.5 Support
    - Internal pre-2.7 OrderedDicts
    - AnyJSON System
    - Secret surprise for the PEP8-strict folks
    - Various bug fixes


Thanks to tox, the codebase is now continuously tested against CPython 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, and PyPy-c v1.4.

The next steps are to add:

    - Tablib.ext Namespace Package (for django-tablib, tablib-extras, &c.)
    - Hooks System (e.g. post-append, pre-export, &c. )
