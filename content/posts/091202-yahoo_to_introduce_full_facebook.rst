Continuing its commitment to be the center of people's online

integration with Facebook that unites social experiences from

Internet's largest online communities to make it easier for people
to stay connected," said Jim Stoneham, vice president of
Communities for Yahoo!. "It also enables us to further the Yahoo!

more open, social and personally relevant for the more than 500
million people that visit Yahoo! each month."
