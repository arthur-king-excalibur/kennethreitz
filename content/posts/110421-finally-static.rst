I've been wanting to convert my webiste from a WordPress-powered
application to a static for a long time now. I tried a few different
systems, but nothing was flexible enough for my needs.

I almost sat down and wrote something myself, but luckly I found
Alex Metaireau's incredible
`Pelican <http://docs.notmyidea.org/alexis/pelican/>`_ project. So, now
my  website is now statically generated with a combination of all my
favorite tools: ReStructured Text, Jinja2, Python, and Git.

The move is far from perfect, but I'm glad I finally did it. All existing
comments are all gone. There's no longer a mobile version. Many of the old
blog posts are malformed (and a big cunk should just be removed entirely).

But, these things will happen in time. It feel good to start fresh.
