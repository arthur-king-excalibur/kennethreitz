Jeff Atwood of `Coding Horror <http://codinghorror.com>`_ has
developed a sure fire test to filter out *good programmers* from
*bad ones*. It's called
`the FizzBuzz test <http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html>`_,
and it's a very simple problem to solve. Enjoy! If you'd like to

"FizzBuzz" elif not i % 3: print "Fizz" elif not i % 5: print
"Buzz" else: print i
