|image| A couple months ago, I wrote a real simple post on
`Google Reader <http://kennethreitz.com/blog/the-ultimate-rss-feed-reader/>`_,
so you know why I love it so. Well, having an iPhone is wonderful,
but coming up with great reading material isn't the best when
you're trying to use mobile safari. What happens if you don't have
internet access?
**Problem Solved**
Byline is a fantastic iPhone app that works as a google reader
client. Once a post is read on the device, it is marked as read on
google reader, so you'll never have to go back and check which
posts you read. This is a massive time saver, and reading with it
is a breeze. I highly Recommend! It is well worth the **$1.99** I
spent for it. It makes my world a better place to live. :)
