GitHub + Strategy

GitHub is currently `down <http://github.com>`_. And that is very
sad. However, they have an
`Awesome Angry Unicorn <http://github.com/images/error/angry_unicorn.png>`_.
And this unicorn makes me smile, even though I can't get to any of
my projects. If you're going to make a web application, give it
some personality. This will not only keep your userbase
entertained, but will serve as a nice insurance package when you
let them down. |image|
