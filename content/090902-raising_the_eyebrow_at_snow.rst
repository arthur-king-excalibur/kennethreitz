Raising the Eyebrow at Snow Leopard

Snow Leopard has been a huge item in the media lately. After months
of media hype and build up, the day it was released, millions of
Apple customers flooded the social web, telling everyone of their
upgrade. It was all we heard about for days. And I’m still hearing
about it.

I’m typically quite an early adopter, but I have yet to make the
update.

Why? Here’s a list of applications that I use every day that will
no longer function as soon as I update to Snow Leopard:


-  GeekTool [resolved]
-  Visor for Terminal
-  Smart Scroll
-  TextMate [resolved]
-  Magnifique
-  Quicksilver Preferences! :(

I’m a lover of all that is new and wonderful, but some of these
applications are essential to my workflow (some more than others of
course). I could work around them of course, but I’m so fond of
them, I don’t really want to switch. Not to mention I’ll mention my
custom icons and theme.

Hopefully all of these issues will be fixed soon. As soon as they
are, I’ll be able to fully enjoy these features:


-  Google Contacts & Calendar Support!!!
-  Exchange!
-  Context-sensitive Menus
-  Python 2.6 is bundled (with easy\_stetup!!!)
-  All of those great Dev API’s (like grand central)

I love that fact that on any install of Snow Leopard, if I want to
install some new libraries, all that I will have to do is type:
sudo easy\_install libraryname

Of course, I can do this just fine right now. But how awesome will
it be to do that out of the box? Life couldn’t be sweeter. I can’t
wait!
