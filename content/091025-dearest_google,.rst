Dearest Google,

I'm sorry for taking you for granted. You supply my phone number,
email address, primary chat platform, site's analytics, the
ultimate rss reader, some money on the side. Almost all of the
knowledge in my brain has been brought to me by (or through) you.
Without you, I'd be so lost. Never forget that. And \*\*never\*\*
abuse that. Sincerely yours, Kenneth Reitz
