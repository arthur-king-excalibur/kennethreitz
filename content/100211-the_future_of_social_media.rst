I'm all over Google Buzz. It's exactly what I've been looking for.
> Imagine taking elements of Twitter, Yammer, Foursquare, Yelp, and
other social services, and shoving them together into one package.
Now imagine covering that package in a layer that looks a lot like
FriendFeed. Now imagine shoving that package inside of Gmail.
That’s Buzz. — MG Siegler of

I couldn't say it any better myself. I highly encourage anyone and
everyone to start using it as your main social aggregator
immediately. This is software sophistication at it's finest. Check
