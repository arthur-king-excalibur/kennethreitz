Snow, snow, snow, snow. I've never been so tired of the word. My
small town of Winchester, VA suffered from over 3 feet of snow over
the past week. Everything shutdown. I am reminded importance of
infrastructure. I lived in Minnesota for 5 years, and have never
seen so much panic from some simple snow. They have the
infrastructure in place there. They can handle the snow. Winchester
was totally unprepared for it. It's amazing.
