I am passionate about many things, including code,  electronic music, and photography.

I specialize in candid, street, and available-light photography. My kit:

- Leica M9-P
- Voitlander Nokton 35mm f/1.2


Previously I had a fantastic Canon kit (Canon 5DmkII, 35L, 50L, 85L, and 135L) and the incredible Fujifilm x100. I found myself quite tornâ€”I really wanted the mechanical interaction and size of the x100, with the performance and flexibility of the 5DmkII.

So, I sold everything and got the Leica M9. I couldn't be happier.
