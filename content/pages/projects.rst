The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python
developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration,
and usage of Python on a daily basis.

Requests: Python HTTP for Humans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requests is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for
human beings. It allows you to send GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, and DELETE
HTTP requests. You can add headers, form data, multipart files, and
parameters with simple Python dictionaries, and access the response data
in the same way. It’s powered by httplib, urllib3, and good intentions.
