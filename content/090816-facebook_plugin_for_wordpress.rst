`Blake <http://twitter.com/RealNerd>`_, a PHP engineer at
`Squidoo <http://squidoo.com>`_, has a blog called
`The Why and the How <http://www.thewhyandthehow.com/>`_. You
should check it out, he writes really good articles and shares
great

My friend and coworker
`Aaron Collegeman <http://aaroncollegeman.com/>`_ decided to write
a WordPress plugin that automatically replaces the built-in
WordPress commenting system with Facebookâ€™s.

It is under active development and will eventually it will s
backend upport storage of comments, but for now you can do
everything from Facebook. In the meantime, you should a
`grab a copy <http://code.google.com/p/wpfb/>`_ and see it in
action for yourself.
