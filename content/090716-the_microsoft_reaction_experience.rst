It seems like Microsoft base its entire product line nowadays on
reactions.

They will be apparently be opening Microsoft Retailer stores across
the nation soon. Why? I mean, I know they have the Zune, the XBox,
and, well, Windows. But why a store? It works great for Apple â€“ But
Apple and Microsoft are two very different companies. Nowadays,
Apple is an innovator. Microsoft is a copy-cat essentially. A few
things are excluded from this of course (Sharepoint), but in
general, the company just isn't all that Creative. I mean
Silverlight? Flash has been out for well over 8 years. Why even try
to compete? Sure Flash is a ridiculous resource hog and it's great
that you want to make something better. But Microsoft: please, for
once, try to make something NEW for a change?
