Crossing Over to the Dark Side

Well, I've done it. I've crossed over. To .NET.

I will continue to be a complete open-source junkie of course, but
during the work hours, I will no longer be working with PHP and
Python. I will now be working with .NET and SharePoint.

I was presented with a rather good reason for this actually:

"Using SharePoint gives our clients a tremendous amount of security
â€“ they can trust that if, for whatever reason, something were to
happen to us, their software could still be serviced by someone
else." That's certainly justifiable and understandable. That's a
pretty good idea actually. I like it.

After looking into ASP.NET, I was actually quite surprised. The
code is a lot cleaner than PHP. It looks rather powerful actually.

Anyway, that's why I've crossed over. No hard feelings :)
