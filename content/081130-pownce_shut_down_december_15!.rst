    Ladies and Gentleman, I have very sad news... Pownce is being shut
    down. Yes, you heard it. One hour ago, I received an email from my
    beloved Pownce admins. We are sad to announce that Pownce is
    shutting down on December 15, 2008. As of today, Pownce will no
    longer be accepting new users or new pro accounts. To help with
    your transition, we have built an export tool so you can save your
    content. You can find the export tool at Settings > Export. Please
    export your content by December 15, 2008, as the site will not be
    accessible after this date. Please visit our new home to find out
    more:

    Our thanks go out to everyone who contributed to the Pownce
    community, The Pownce Crew


Chances are, this news will either have you screaming at the top of
your lungs or making you shake your head saying "Wah"? And to the
Web 2.0 world/micro-blogosphere, shame on you. #Shame! This is a
wonderful internet startup that was built on a framework framework
and has more features than you can shake a stick at, yet still you
use Twitter.
