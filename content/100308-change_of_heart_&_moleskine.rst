## I've always been a huge fan of
`Mokeskine notebooks <http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&x=0&ref_=nb_sb_ss_i_0_9&y=0&field-keywords=moleskine&url=search-alias=aps&sprefix=moleskine&tag=bookforkind-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957>`_|image|
& I use them for everythingâ€”from product ideas to mockup sketching.
It all started when I was a student at George Mason University. The
student book store had a small selection by the checkout counter. I
bought a pocket-sized ruled notebook to keep track of my todo list.
As soon as I unravelled the shrink wrap, my attention was brought
to the informational leaflet. I was instantly hooked. After three
years of using the Hard Lined Large Notebooks, I've recently
migrated to a notebook that better suits my needs: The \*Soft
Squared Large Notebook\* is the ultimate Moleskine.
