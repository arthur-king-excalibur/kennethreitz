To elaborate on my
`last post <http://kennethreitz.com/blog/wasted-talent/>`_:

Here's an example of some wasted talent:

I know a guy who says he wants to be an Engineer. He loves
engineering, but, for various reasons, he is no longer attending
Virginia Tech this semester. Very sad. So what is he doing now?
He's been applying for a job at Old Navy and Target. Why? He just
spent over $20,000 for a year and a half of top-knotch schooling in
his desired field! You'd think he'd at least apply for an
internship at some Engineering firm or something.

When I presented the idea to him, he said that the thought had
never crossed his mind.
