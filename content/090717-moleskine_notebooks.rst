I no longer have an iPhone (for now), so lately I've been utilizing
my good old Moleskine Notebook. Man I love this thing.

I had been recording everything in
`Evernote <http://evernote.com>`_, which was epically amazing
(esspecially since I have so many computers). There's just
something about actually writing things down physically in one of
these notebooks.
