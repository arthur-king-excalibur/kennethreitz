While I doubt that you'll never read this... I can't help but
imagine that one day you might. I know that blogging isn't your
thing, and you could probally care less about my website - it's
just something that takes me away from you at times.

But perhaps one day these things will mean something to you... And
when that one day comes, I hope to put a smile on your face.

You mean more to me than anything on this earth, Bessie. We're
supposed to meet around 1pm today. I can't wait! It's going to be
wonderful.

I love you with all of my heart, and will cherish you forever.

Sincerely Yours,

Kenneth Reitz
