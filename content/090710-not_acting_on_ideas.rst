Not Acting on Ideas

As of yesterday, my second idea that I actually thought would work
well was thought up by someone else. The first instance was a game
that me and my friend `@MikeXocon <http://twitter.com/mikeXocon/>`_
came up with. After reading up on some man laws one day back at
college, we thought of the idea of making a game where the player
needs to strategically pick the correct urinal to use (men will
understand). It was decided that we would work on it this summer.
We were really serious. I almost bought the domain name.
Well, you can see a screenshot below of one of the top apps on the
AppStore now. Epic fail.

The second idea I had was creating a site that allows you to
prebuffer and schedule tweets. All the time I log on to Twitter and
post 5-10 things right in a row, which is just annoying. There's
not other solution though. If I don't tweet immediately, I won't
remember. So, I was going to make a site that would allow you to do
just that, API and all. Well,
`@collegeman <http://twitter.com/collegeman>`_ sent me a link today
to `HootSuite <http://hootsuite.com>`_, a Twitter client on crack
that offers a large array of features, including the ability to
have pending tweets. Yay.
I'm upset or anything of course. Its pretty cool that I came up
with these ideas, and someone else did as well. Next time I'll have
to jump the shark I suppose!
