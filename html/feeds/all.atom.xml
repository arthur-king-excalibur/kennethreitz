It allows you create tables of data using standard Python datatypes, manipulate them, and easily export to Excel, JSON, YAML, and CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic Usages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;tablib&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;first_name&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;last_name&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;gpa&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;John&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Adams&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;George&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Washington&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;67&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tablib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Dataset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can manipulate your data like a standard Python list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Henry&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Ford&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;83&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;first_name&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;[&amp;#39;John&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;George&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Henry&amp;#39;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily export your data to JSON, YAML, XLS, and CSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yaml&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;- {age: 90, first_name: John, last_name: Adams}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;- {age: 83, first_name: Henry, last_name: Ford}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;csv&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;first_name,last_name,age&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;John,Adams,90&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="go"&gt;Henry,Ford,83&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="gp"&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;people.xls&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;w&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;xls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

in Fairfax, VA and finally purchased a MacBook. I've been wanting
one for quite a while – ever since I fell deeply in love with OS X
after adopting an old 12&amp;quot; G4 PowerBook I've been using for the past
5 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to get the 2.5 GHz 13&amp;quot; MacBook Pro. This will be my
full-time machine for the next 4+ years hopefully. With specs this
good and a case this sturdy, I see no reason why it shouldn't last
me for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thoroughly pleased with the purchase so far. If you've been
planning on getting a MacBook, &lt;em&gt;now is the time to get one&lt;/em&gt;. The
base line 13&amp;quot; Aluminum Pro model is only $1100 right now –&amp;nbsp;cheaper
than most of the refurbished polycarbonates with lower specs.
Anyway, I'll post lists of my software choices (including TextMate
Plugins and Bundles) soon for those interested. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

keep all of my GitHub repos up to date and organized. It updates /
clones all private, public, and watched repositories from your
account. It also detects if your repo is a mirror or fork, and
files it accordingly. My watched list is huge, but I like to have a
local copy of my favorite libraries. You never know if the owner
will take it down, or worse, move it to another SCM! ;-) The script
depends on the &lt;strong&gt;GitHub2&lt;/strong&gt; module. If you don't have it, you
can install it easily.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$ pip install github2
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend running this from &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;~/repos/&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;::&lt;/dt&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Kenneth Reitz's GitHub Syncer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script uses the GitHub API to get a list of all forked, mirrored, public, and
private repos in your GitHub account. If the repo already exists locally, it will
update it via git-pull. Otherwise, it will properly clone the repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will organize your repos into the following directory structure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repos
├── forks    (public fork repos)
├── mirrors  (public mirror repos)
├── private  (private repos)
├── public   (public repos)
├── watched  (this script)
└── sync.py  (this script)&lt;/li&gt;

I
had enough. so I tried to kill it, and discovered a nice hidden
feature. rm -fr ~/.Trash ln -s /dev/null ~/.Trash&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when you delete a file in Finder, you get a nice pop-up
warning that the file will be permanently deleted.

Bliss. ### Update (Setember 25th, 2010): As it turns out, OS X
defaults to this behavior whenever ~/.Trash is unwritable as a
folder. If you were to place any file in ~/.Trash, you would see
the same behaviour. Oh well, it's still rather useful in function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/kennethreitz/tablib"&gt;Tablib&lt;/a&gt;. Tablib is a
simple module for working with tabular datasets. It allows you
create tables of data using standard Python datatypes, manipulate
them, and easily export to Excel, JSON, YAML, and CSV. **Basic
Usage**: import tablib&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
headers = ('first_name', 'last_name', 'gpa')
data = [('John', 'Adams', 90), ('George', 'Washington', 67)]

data = tablib.Dataset(*data, headers=headers)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can maniuplate your data like a standard Python list: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
data.append(('Henry', 'Ford', 83))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print data['first_name']
['John', 'George', 'Henry']

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; del data[1]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can easily export your data to JSON, YAML, XLS, and CSV. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;
print data.json [{&amp;quot;first_name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;John&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;last_name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Adams&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;gpa&amp;quot;: 90}, {&amp;quot;first_name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Henry&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;last_name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Ford&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gpa&amp;quot;:
83}]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print data.yaml
- {age: 90, first_name: John, last_name: Adams}
- {age: 83, first_name: Henry, last_name: Ford}

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; print data.csv
first_name,last_name,age
John,Adams,90
Henry,Ford,83

&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; open('people.xls', 'w').write(data.xls)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel files with multiple sheets are also supported (via the
`DataBook` object).

I'm a
passionate Python developer for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://netapp.com"&gt;NetApp&lt;/a&gt;. I
typically spend my nights developing a number of open source
projects, and my weekends architecting the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-hardware-are-you-using"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What hardware are you using?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My sole machine is a 2010 MacBook Pro running a Core i7 processor
at 2.66 GHz w/ 8GB of DDR3
RAM. It's 15&amp;quot; non-reflective screen runs at a beautiful 1680 x
1050. It features both a 250GB SSD and 500 GB HDD, for a total of
750GB of local storage, thanks to the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mcetech.com/optibay/"&gt;OptiBay&lt;/a&gt;. I often have it
hooked up to one of many 23&amp;quot; LCD monitors. For general audio, I
sport a pair of Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins P5 Headphones. If I'm in a
high-fidelity mood, I listen through a pair of open-backed SR-60s
from Grado Labs. For telephony, I have an HTC Supersonic (EVO)
running running the Nighty Android 2.2 (Froyo) CyanogenMod v6. This
also functions as a perfectly portable hotspot. I read
documentation and play arcade games on a 64GB Apple iPad (wifi). I
play a PSP Go solely for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. I have
a large number of very powerful

servers at my disposal for various projects and builds. My system
is backed up regularly to a cheap 1TB Western Digital drive. My
media archives are backed up to a 1.5TB Seagate drive. My media
exists on a NAS attached to my Netgear WNR3500L router. My code is
backed up to various Git repositories local and across the net. All
web projects and databases of relevance are backed up to Amazon S3
on a nightly basis, along with all my tweets, Flickr photos, and
Gmail messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;And what software?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I develop and
live on the latest build of Snow Leopard. My main Python
environment is the latest 2.7 release, along with well managed
virtualenvs for all other releases
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.mfabrik.com/2010/07/16/easily-install-all-python-versions-under-linux-and-osx-using-collective-buildout-python/"&gt;via Buildout&lt;/a&gt;.
I also employ a very large number of virtual machines, via VMWare
Fusion 3. I have a particularly efficient XP VM that is always up,
providing me with OneNote 2010. I'd do anything for Mactopia to
port OneNote to OS X. Anything. My development environment consists
of TextMate + PeepOpen, [most recently] PyCharm, SequelPro,
Titanium Mobile, Transmit, and GitX. I love using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.tuffcode.com/"&gt;HTTPScoop&lt;/a&gt; for request sniffing. My
favorite command-line utilities are: Terminal.app w/ Zsh + Git,
JoelTheLion's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/joelthelion/autojump"&gt;autojump&lt;/a&gt;,
Defunkt's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/defunkt/hub"&gt;Hub&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/defunkt/gist"&gt;Gist&lt;/a&gt;, Mcxl's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/"&gt;homebrew&lt;/a&gt;, nicksieger's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/nicksieger/jsonpretty"&gt;jsonpretty&lt;/a&gt;, and
Rtomayko's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/rtomayko/bcat"&gt;bcat&lt;/a&gt;. On servers, I
typically run the latest Ubuntu Server release, or CentOS (but only
if I have to). I carry out heavy-duty writing with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.the-soulmen.com/ulyssescore/"&gt;Ulysses Core&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.acqualia.com/soulver/"&gt;Soulver&lt;/a&gt; is the best
number-crunching application around. I don't know how I lived
without it. My audio production work is carried out in Adobe
Audition CS3 and FL Studio 9. I use Adobe CS5 Master Collection for
light design work and photo retouching. Photoshop Lightroom for
kosher photography dark room work. I've been meaning to get into
Fireworks for wireframing, but haven't had the time as of late. As
for architecture work, I utilize OmniGraffle for diagraming,
Mockingbird / Balsamiq for mockups, and MindNode Pro for
mind-mapping. For note taking, as mentioned, I use OneNote 2010.
Nothing compares, except my Soft Large Squared Moleskine Notebook.
My tasks are managed with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://culturedcode.com/things/"&gt;Things.app&lt;/a&gt;. I can't wait till
they roll out proper syncing. If they don't do it fast enough, I'll
be switching to Macman's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.taskforceapp.com/"&gt;Taskforce&lt;/a&gt;. I use Kindle for
purchased books, and iBooks for PDF reading on the iPad. I consume
Google Reader via &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://reederapp.com/ipad/"&gt;Reeder&lt;/a&gt;, the most
beautiful application I have ever used. For Remote Desktop I use
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cord.sourceforge.net/"&gt;CoRD.app&lt;/a&gt;. Backups are performed
by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://arrsync.sourceforge.net/"&gt;arRsync.app&lt;/a&gt;, a beautiful
interface for rsync. My desktop's windows are managed well with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/cinch/"&gt;Cinch.app&lt;/a&gt;. My music
library is provided by Spotify at offline, 320KBPS Ogg Vorbis
goodness. In the rare occasion that Spotify is missing an artist, I
use 320KBPS MP3s and FLAC recordings for the ultra-special tracks
(e.g. Liquid Tension Experiment). I buy my MP3s from the
(wonderful) Amazon MP3 Store. I keep my video library nice and
organized in iTunes, regardless of format, with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.iflicksapp.com/"&gt;iFlicks&lt;/a&gt;. I stream 1080 videos,
NetFlix, and BlueRay Disks with a Play Station 3 Slim. I play
emulated retro video games Wii. Best $200 I've ever spent. For
communication, I use iChat + Chax, Linkinus, Echofon, and Skype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-would-be-your-dream-setup"&gt;

The genius of the iPad is that it cannot get things like viruses.
It is a closed platform. You can’t put apps on it. You can’t write

why geeks hate it and normal people will love it.&lt;/p&gt;

Snow, snow, snow, snow. I've never been so tired of the word. My
small town of Winchester, VA suffered from over 3 feet of snow over
the past week. Everything shutdown. I am reminded importance of
infrastructure. I lived in Minnesota for 5 years, and have never
seen so much panic from some simple snow. They have the
infrastructure in place there. They can handle the snow. Winchester
was totally unprepared for it. It's amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

Yes please.</title><link href="http://kennethreitz.com//spotify-in-the-us-yes-please.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-01-17T19:03:00Z</updated><author><name>Kenneth Reitz</name></author><id>tag:kennethreitz.com,2010-01-17://spotify-in-the-us-yes-please.html/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;##I spent about 8 hours last night obtaining a Premium Spotify
account in the US, and I've never been happier. As you know,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://spotify.com"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; is only available in the UK, Spain,
and France. So, the only way to signup for an account it to take a
trip overseas... virtually. ## Step 1: Signup for a virtual private
server Signup for a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://linode.com"&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt; account, and buy
a 360 VPS. Linode allows you to choose a datacenter when you buy a
VPS, and luckily, they have a datacenter in the UK. This will run
you $20 a month. ## Step 2: Install Ubuntu and Boot Your VPS
Install Ubuntu Server on your new british hackbox. You can SSH in
to test it out. Have fun. Make sure openssh-server is installed. ##
Step 3: Edit Hosts File Append the following lines to your
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/hosts&lt;/tt&gt; file: 127.0.0.1 spotify.com 127.0.0.1
www.spotify.com [your vps ip] hackbox&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;## Step 4: Open a Reverse SSH Forwarding Tunnel sudo ssh -C
&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:root&amp;#64;hackbox"&gt;root&amp;#64;hackbox&lt;/a&gt; -L 443:spotify.com:443 sudo ssh -C root&amp;#64;hackbox -L
80:spotify.com:480&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations. You're now a Brit. ## Step 5: Create an Account
While creating an account, you are prompted for you postal code. I
did some
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;safe=off&amp;amp;client=safari&amp;amp;rls=en&amp;amp;q=winchester+hampshire+office&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;aqi="&gt;google-fu&lt;/a&gt;
and used &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;SO23 8TH&lt;/tt&gt; as my postal code for Winchester, Hampshire
UK. &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://spotify.com/en/download/"&gt;Download the client&lt;/a&gt;. ##
Step 6: Enjoy :) You now have unlimited access to a library of
~8,000,000 tracks, as if they were on your own computer. Once every
two weeks, you'll have to reopen your SSH tunnels and login at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://spotify.com"&gt;spotify.com&lt;/a&gt; to proveyou'll be good to go.
This restriction is lifted if you signup for a Premium account. I
highly recommend this, as it allows you to listen to your music at
320 kbps. I'd tell you how, but I'd rather enjoy the fruits of my
hard labor.&lt;/p&gt;

startup. ### 1. Simplify Anyone can make something complex. It
takes thoughtful planning, consideration, and discipline to make
something simple. Simple = elegant. The same applies to your
business. ### 2. Get some Humility Don't assume you know what your
audience wants.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2009/12/13/how-to-create-a-global-phenomenon-for-less-than-10000/"&gt;Find out first&lt;/a&gt;.
### 3. Release a Real Product 10,000 great ideas are worthless if
you never act upon them. Pick one. Pick three and mix. Release. ###
4. The Opposite is Also True Your product can be enormously
successful for a single feature. Someone else's product will be
even more successful for excluding that same feature. ### 5. Loose
the Bulk Startups
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cdixon.tumblr.com/post/311546950/things-startups-do-and-dont-need"&gt;don't need much&lt;/a&gt;.

things simple. You'll thrive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/12/21st_century_phone.html"&gt;interesting article&lt;/a&gt;
today on Apple's marketing strategy. A certain section stood out to
me, regarding their hardware manufacturing: &amp;gt; Apple is an
experience company. They're a high-end marque; if they &amp;gt; were in
the automobile business, they'd be BMW, Mercedes, and &amp;gt; Porsche
rolled into one. They own about 12% of the PC market in the &amp;gt;
USA... but 91% of the high end of the PC market (laptops over $999,
&amp;gt; desktops over $699).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;## The Point: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/"&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://37signals.com/"&gt;37Signals&lt;/a&gt; both recommend marketing
yourself to the early adopters and geeks. Apple, however, does the
opposite. They market themselves to the middle market — the
incredibly non-technical. The geeks come on their own, with no
marketing needed. They love it. And this makes Apple *enormously*
successful. **Develop your software/experience for the
masses**. Make the geeks love it, but make them find it on their
own. Just a thought.&lt;/p&gt;

in my site loading speeds when using the service (due to
drastically improved domain name lookups). There's really no
downside to using the system. It's significantly faster than most
ISP's own DNS servers, and it's updated far more frequently.
##Announcing OpenDNS Monetization OpenDNS now offers a new service
called &lt;strong&gt;OpenDNS Deluxe&lt;/strong&gt;, which is tailed for the average
household as well as smaller companies. ###Premium Support It
allows users to have an ad-free experience and have priority over
free members. The price for this service is only $9.95 a year. Not
too bad! ###For Power Users They are also offering a very robust
&lt;strong&gt;OpenDNS Enterprise&lt;/strong&gt; edition for medium to fortune 500 companies.
It has many advanced features such as: delegated administration,
advanced reporting, and malware site protection. ###Pricing That

have a lovely book store. Quite lovely. I love the books you sell.
I love the music you play. I love the coffee you serve. I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt;
the Moleskine Notebooks you sell. Everything about your store
tailors itself perfectly to people like me. You strive to make a
person feel intellectual and important, and that is marketed almost
flawlessly. You seem to have forgotten one key demographic,
however. If a tech-savvy web developer wants to go and play with
his newly-developed web design skills he obtained from books out of
&lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; technology section, he is free to bring his laptop into your
lovely café. Awesome. You even offer power outlets. All the
sweeter. So, he decides to bring his laptop in one day to play with
his newly purchased python web development book. He connects to
your aptly named “Borders” network, and types “&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://google.com"&gt;http://google.com&lt;/a&gt;”
into his address bar, excited to be connected to his world in such
a convenient location. His face of joy then abruptly changes,
however, when he realizes that he has to fork out SEVEN DOLLARS to
use the network. &lt;strong&gt;Seven Dollars&lt;/strong&gt;. You could feed a starving child
in Africa for a WEEK with $7. There is no justification. There is
no excuse. This is downright stupid on your part. Do you have any
idea how much business you are turning down by doing this? If your
stores offered free wifi, chances are, I’d be there three to four
times every week, buying coffee every time, and most likely a book
every other time. That is a LOT of business. And there are many
more people like me. Many more. People like me love your stores. We
love the atmosphere. We love the books. We love the knowledge. We
love the Moleskines. And we also love the internet. Apparently,
more than you know. I understand that you have an agreement with
AT&amp;amp;T, and i’m sure they have wonderful salesman that assure that
you are offering a service to your employees. They are wrong. Very
wrong. I know for a fact that I’d be a customer time and time again
if you offered this service for free. And I’m sure your café and
book sales would go up at least 15%. From what I understand, your
profits are decreasing heavily at the moment. I believe your stock
is currently worth $3.34 a share. Impressive. So what do you have
to lose? In the meantime, I’ll be taking my daily $7 coffee
excursions to Panera, where wifi is free. Kindest Regards, Kenneth
Reitz # Border's Respnse Dear Kenneth, Thank you for contacting
Borders Customer Care regarding Wifi service. We welcome your
comments, as we rely on feedback from customers to improve on the

thinker. I was never one to get involved in cliques or social
ladders. Despite the fact that I was raised being constantly told
that grades were the single most important thing in my life, I
could never accept that. So I didn’t. I just did enough to get by.
I didn’t pay attention much in class. I had no reason to. Class was
beyond boring. So I’d spend all hours of the night hacking away on
my computer, soaking in all I could, and most of the school day
sleeping during class when I could get away with it. When there was
a test, I’d try my hardest to stay awake, answer the questions as
best I could – typically earning a low C in my Honors/AP Classes,
and a low B in my “Ordinary” Classes. I found a good balance. Why
would I study for 30 hours a week to get better grades when I could
get by with 0 hours? So, I graduated. And I did the next logical
thing: I went to college. Ahh, college. The most important decision
you could ever make in your life. The time to “make it or break
it”. Where every young man goes to be become a man. So I went.
While high-school never engaged me, I assumed that courses about
career-relevant subjects would interest me in a university setting.
I was wrong. I was very, very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="college-life"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;College Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied Plato, Homer, and Socrates, Turing Machines, and
Single-State-Automata. I analyzed the progression of American
Popular Music from the 1920s to today. I learned how to draw, play
the marimba properly, and splatter paint on walls. I attempted
jujitsu. Wonderful life experience. But what does any of this have
to do with setting the foundation of a career? Nothing. At all. Of
course, the higher up you go, the more relevant the courses get to
your chosen major. But I didn’t want to wait. Especially when I was
paying $20,000 a year for this. It was mostly useless information.
The average college education in America costs 9 cents a minute.
Every minute. Every day. A complete waste. And I was working 35
hours a week as a graphics design intern, working at odd hours of
the night, attempting to pay for all of this. It was impossible,
and I was unengaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-plunge"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Plunge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after totally losing
interest in class or anything related to it, I gave up and dropped
out. I didn’t want to get further in debt. So I moved back home,
defeated, and tried my hardest to get my life back in order. I got
my high-school job back at McDonald’s. I worked harder than I ever
have in my life. I didn’t have anything else better to do, so I
worked as much as I could all the time. I worked one 65 hour week -
but that got old really fast. I was again, unengaged. Then, one
day, I quit McDonald’s without notice. Not best practice of
course, but I didn’t want to spend any more time there. It’s
strange what a terrible work environment it is. After a few short
weeks, you begin to think there isn’t anything outside those walls.
It was clear that it wasn’t getting me anywhere, so I set out with
my laptop to try to find something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-it-all-turned-around"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How It All Turned Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot of time on some freelance
websites, where you bid for odd jobs, usually settling for some
ridiculously low amount of money here and there. That didn’t last
long. I remembered coming across a guy on Twitter from my hometown,
Winchester, Virginia, who was quite into the internet and
technology. That’s pretty rare in these parts, so I looked him up.
What I found was a local &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://brightcowork.com"&gt;cowork&lt;/a&gt;
center. I went and checked out the cowork, and what I found blew my
mind. In this little building off the historic old-town walking
mall was a room. Inside: the COO of a major internet company, tech
consultants, graphic designers, writers, author, bloggers,
freelancers, and so much more. I met everyone in and around town. I
sat in on think tank lunches. People cared about what I had to say.
We collaborated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="collaboration-is-everything"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Collaboration is Everything.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my life, I was meeting
interesting people with awesome experience, willing to share and
collaborate what they have learned with me. And I did the same. I
soaked in endless amounts of information. One simple room full of a
few people turned on some switch in me that the education system
had failed to do year after year after year: teach me something. I
was finally engaged. *Fully* engaged. As soon as I realized that,
my entire life changed. I started thriving on my own, getting
dozens of clients. Suddenly, I had a life with significantly less
stress and worry. No tuition fees! I realized how valuable my
skills were and how I didn’t have to be part of the institution if
I didn’t want to be. I rose above. I am now a Web Applications
Developer at a respectful technology firm. No degree. No debt. Only
an open mind. I gain more knowledge and experience in a single
workday than I did during my entire college career. I’m in the real
world. And I’m loving every minute of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I’m comfortable saying that dropping
out of college has been the best decision I’ve ever made. If I
would have gone through the entire education program, what would I
have to show for it? $150,000 in debt, a piece of paper, and four
years less of your life. No real experience. No connections. Just a
piece of paper. And nothing more. Please bear these things in mind
before you decide to spend $150,000 on a bachelor’s degree in a
field you’re not so certain about. Personally, I’d rather spend
that money on something that will actually benefit me: like a
house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce the limited beta of Amazon Virtual
Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), a secure and seamless bridge between
your existing IT infrastructure and the AWS cloud. Amazon VPC
enables you to connect your existing infrastructure to a set of
isolated AWS compute resources via a Virtual Private Network (VPN)
connection, and to extend your existing management capabilities
such as security services, firewalls, and intrusion detection
systems to include your AWS resources. Amazon VPC integrates today
with Amazon EC2 compute resources, and we will integrate Amazon VPC
with other AWS services in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some service highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isolated Network Access - Amazon VPC provides end-to-end network
isolation by utilizing an IP address range you specify, and by
routing all network traffic between your VPC and datacenter through
an industry-standard encrypted IPsec VPN. This allows you to
leverage your pre-existing security infrastructure, such as
firewalls and intrusion detection systems to inspect network
traffic going to and from a VPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible - You control your VPC in much the same way you control
your datacenter, using familiar network concepts such as subnets
and gateways. With Amazon VPC, you can 1) freely create subnets to
organize your resources based on the criteria you define, 2) assign
an IP address range for Amazon EC2 instances within subnets, and 3)
configure secure connectivity to determine who can access your AWS
cloud-based resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of Both Worlds - Amazon VPC enables you to build a bridge
between your existing IT resources and your isolated resources
within the AWS cloud, enabling you to use both worlds in concert.
Now, you can build hybrid architectures that allow you to take full
advantage of the benefits of the AWS cloud - true elasticity
without owning the capital expense of the hardware or datacenter
(given AWS's pay-as-you-go pricing) - and yet still have the
network isolation and secure connectivity you would enjoy if all
the resources were in your own datacenter. With Amazon VPC, you can
gradually move to the AWS cloud, replicate your entire data center,
or anywhere in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliable - Amazon VPC is built using Amazon's own world-class
technology infrastructure. Like other Amazon Web Services, the
service runs within Amazon's proven global network infrastructure
and datacenters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon VPC is available on a pay-as-you-go basis with no up-front
fee, minimum spend or long-term commitment required. Please see the
Amazon VPC product page for more information on this exciting new
service, and for details on how to request access to the limited
beta. We will admit participants over time, but wanted to let you
know about it now, seeing that this has been a much-requested AWS
capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon Web Services Team&lt;/p&gt;

rapid development frameworks, primarily Django (Python!), Grails
(Groovy / Java), and Symfony (PHP). I’ve been enjoying it. Alot.
Life has never been better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRY tactics. Code portability. Who likes to repeat themselves
anyway? It’s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite concept to date is the Object Relational Model (ORM).
Database-agnostcisty is fantastic. Not sure what database you want
to use? Worry about it later. A client wants to switch to MySQL
because SQLServer is costing too much? No problem. How much of my
codebase will I have to change? About six charecters. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why not take this concept, and apply it elsewhere? I’m currently
doing some work for a startup, and we are having trouble deciding
which online payment service to use/support: PayPal, Amazon
Payments, or Google Checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My solution is to write a webPaySystem module that integrates all
of these payment systems into one single class. But, before I spend
the time to write this, I’d like to extend this question to the
Python / Django community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you find this useful in your web (and business desktop)
applications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comment and let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

I’m not positive,
but I most likely inherited my love for this concept from my
intensive Python immersion. I'm so grateful for it. Anyway, DRY is
an essential stage of any developer's workflow. It drastically
enforces good structure, and significantly increases your logical
skills. As with everything in life, there’s a time and place for
DRY. Object oriented programming is one of those places. ## CSS Is
Not DRY Let it be said: CSS is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a programming language. It is
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a programmer’s language. It is not supposed to be. It is a
styling markup language. But for those of us who like to take a
more structured and programmatic approach, CSS is far from ideal. I
want my CSS to do math. I want it to be dynamic. So, that's where
fun little libraries come in to play that generate CSS on the fly
based on logic and rules! I implore you to take a look at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sandbox.pocoo.org/clevercss"&gt;CleverCSS&lt;/a&gt;. The awesome
Python CSS generator. It supports variables, code manipulation,
inheritance, and oh, so much more. I’ll be writing a Django helper
module soon that generates this CSS on the fly. ###See Also: There
is also &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sass-lang.com"&gt;SASS&lt;/a&gt;, or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sass-lang.com"&gt;Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets&lt;/a&gt;. I must
credit it: it seems to be the originator of the concept, has a
significantly cooler name, and is a bit more widely accepted in the
world. Oh, but that’s not written in Python, is it?&lt;/p&gt;

benefit the Social Web as a whole. It’s been going through some
rough times lately, and I think it’s time for a change. Or so I
thought. My first idea was to create a site that was rather
decentralized, allowing all of your content to exist on other
sites, but still allowing for you to interact without locking a
user in. As it turns out, this site already exists. It is called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://friendfeed.com/kennethreitz"&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;em&gt;`I love FriendFeed &amp;lt;http://kennethreitz.com/blog/friendfeed-is-awesome/&amp;gt;`_&lt;/em&gt;.
About a week after I decided that I wanted to get into it,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/blog/friendfeed-is-awesome/"&gt;Facebook decided to purchase it&lt;/a&gt;.
How sad. They claim that it will still be up and running, but we’ll
see if that proves to be the case (I have my fingers crossed).
Pownce (which was powered by Python / Django) was shut down when it
was purchased. I pray this not be the case. Think about this now:
&lt;strong&gt;Why is that even an option&lt;/strong&gt;? Social networking is all about
community and building tribes – So why do we need to have an
organization in charge of our chosen communication platform?
&lt;strong&gt;Here is my proposal&lt;/strong&gt;: Create a community-driven,
community-developed, and community-controlled social networking
site that is truly open source. The community could take care of
everything from feature development to content control. No random
shutting down, buy-outs, or merges. No more random change of
Privacy Policies or Content Ownership battles. No more worries. The
only group of people who would be benefitted would be the community
itself, not some company. An open minded network full of open
minded people working for the better of the community. # The Open
Web of Flow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="step-one-solid-platform-choice"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step One&lt;/strong&gt;: Solid Platform Choice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform choice is the most important. You've seen what happens
when the wrong tool is chosen for the job: look at Twitter: Bad
Planning. We're all familiar with the Fail Whale but we shouldn't.
At all. So what do we use? There's an array of options. .NET? HAHA!
Did you know that there's even
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://membertomember.com/"&gt;a social platform built on top of Microsoft's Sharepoint&lt;/a&gt;?
I bet you didn't. I've installed it a number of times. It's
fantastic (for people who need it). But we don't. At all. What type
of open source project aside Mono is driven by NET developers
anyway? They are in an entirely different mindset than us. Anyway,
the answer is obvious: Django on a LAMP Stack (Linux + Apache +
MySql + Python). We can all agree that Python is freaking amazing.
And it's certianly not going anywhere any time soon. I think google
has proven time-and time again that Python is the language for just
about any job. And when Google's unlayden-swallow project is
complete, all (typically negligible) performance issues will be
eliminated. Done. ### &lt;strong&gt;Step Two&lt;/strong&gt;: Basic Information Architecture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to decide how the whole system will work. FriendFeed has an
excellent system in place. Lets use it. Users can tie everything in
from all of their other websites and steam it on their profile, and
display it all on one page. Everything's streamlined, commentable,
hookable, and readily accessible. Google Profiles rock. But that is
definitely an abandoned project. Lets mix that with a
FriendFeed-style activity stream. Done. ### &lt;strong&gt;Step Three&lt;/strong&gt;:
Sustainability, Audience, and Accessibility&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will we pay for it? How will we get people to contribute? How
will be get people to use it? Answer: Twitter is getting old and
it's getting old fast. It's time for something new. Lets blow them
away and they will ALL hop on board. Allow for easy
external-account migration and account creation and we'll be
golden. ### &lt;strong&gt;Step Four&lt;/strong&gt;: Technical Planning and Engineering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is all the stuff end users don't have to worry about.
Performance. Design. System Administration. Database Engineering.
The geek stuff. I mean come on guys, how awesome would it be to be
able to make a commit to the Twitter live SVN Branch? Epically
awesome. ### &lt;strong&gt;Step Five&lt;/strong&gt;: Community + Collaboration&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the community gets going, there will be no stopping it. In
conclusion, think about what we have to lose? Are you with me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/blog/if-textmate-42/"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt; is one
fantastic text editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I won't bore you with my passion for it, but if you've been
reading my blog for long, you know how I feel.I do the majority of
my development in TextMate, so theme choice is pretty important
(others beg to differ but I disagree – aesthetics are everything).
I tried a number of themes and found some really great ones. I'm
always partial to darker schemes, so I settled on using Vibrant
Ink. Fantastic theme. After a while, I needed a break from the dark
background, and decided to find a more minimalist white-based theme
online. Much to my avail, I discovered that there are no good
ligher-colored themes out there for TextMate. Some come close, but
nothing hits the nail on the head. So I made one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call it &lt;strong&gt;Smoothy&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://media.kennethreitz.com/themes/Smoothy.tmTheme.gif"&gt;screenshot&lt;/a&gt;,

So, after a great number of hours, and realizing that making things
coordinate on black is far easier than white, I settled on a theme
that was colorful, functional, useful, triatic, and
most-importantly, not a piece of crap. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

decided today that it was going to buy
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://friendfeed.com/kennethreitz"&gt;FriendFeed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinion might be a little biased... I just discovered FF
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/blog/friendfeed-is-awesome/"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt;,
and I must say that I've been thoroughly impressed with the service
so far. I've been spending an increasing amount of time on it every
day, and It's most certainly a breath of fresh air from the clogged
mob-congestion of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So apparently someone at Facebook realized this and decided to join
forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is Facebook after? Absorbing the competition? I don't think
so. Did you know FriendFeed is operated by only 11 people? and it
rocks! That's definitely 11 people who are extremely talented and
know exactly what they are doing. Something Facebook needs. They
have been trying to put something together that works as well as FF
for while now. The two merging might not be that bad, as long as FF
marches on. My last favorite social site,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pownce.com"&gt;Pownce&lt;/a&gt;, was shut down when
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sixapart.com"&gt;Six Apart&lt;/a&gt; purchased them for the creation
of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.movabletype.com/motion/"&gt;Motion&lt;/a&gt; – an utter
failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the two companies announced today that FriendFeed will
continue to remain a separate, fully functional entity from
Facebook. Facebook will be integrating features of FriendFeed. Good

blindly follows everything the cult leader, Steve Jobs has to say.
They go out and purchase every iProduct that Apple realeases and
does so with a smile on their face, not realizing that over the
course of four years, they have
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://calacanis.com/2009/08/08/the-case-against-apple-in-five-parts/"&gt;spent about $20,000&lt;/a&gt;
on Apple products alone. They leak photos of an upcoming product
with incredibly low resolution so the masses can pick and decipher
the image, spending countless hours just trying to imagine what
that mysterious new button does. And people do it! They completely
take advantage, but rightfully so. Who could blame them? They are,
after all, a business. It would be foolish for them not to, because
that FanBoy pays thousands of dollars to watch a 3 hour long
commercial, and they love it! They love OSX for no apparent reason
other than they are told to. They go out and buy every single new
iPhone the day that it comes out, when there's clearly nothing
wrong with the one they had. Year after year, they pour more and
more money into their investment in nothing more than a brand that
they thing will change who they are as a person. They want to be
Steve Jobs. They write endless posts about how much money they
spend on Apple products every month, and just can't wait to get
their hands on the next one. This is not that post and I am not
that guy. &lt;img alt="image" src="http://pcmacsmackdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/apple-logo1.jpg" /&gt; I do, however, believe that my recently purchased

on Earth to date. But not because Apple made it. That's irrelevant.
Now please, don't get me wrong: I love Apple. And that's because,
they have a &lt;strong&gt;superior&lt;/strong&gt; operating system and they put an
extraordinary amount of design and thought into every nook and
cranny of every system that they release. This system is designed
well. &lt;em&gt;Incredibly&lt;/em&gt; well. On a side note, I firmly believe that OSX
is the greatest desktop operating system of all time, and I see no
chance of this changing any time soon. From many different
standpoints (End User, Prosumer, Developer, Newbie) this holds
true. I am a fan and follower of one thing and one thing only:
Design. And, for now, Apple hands-down has the greatest sense of
design, both software and hardware in my opinion. But if something
else comes along made by someone else, I'll be sure to give that a
try with an open mind. :)&lt;/p&gt;

in Fairfax, VA and finally purchased a MacBook. I've been wanting
one for quite a while – ever since I fell deeply in love with OS X
after adopting an old 12&amp;quot; G4 PowerBook I've been using for the past
5 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to get the 2.5 GHz 13&amp;quot; MacBook Pro. This will be my
full-time machine for the next 4+ years hopefully. With specs this
good and a case this sturdy, I see no reason why it shouldn't last
me for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thoroughly pleased with the purchase so far. If you've been
planning on getting a MacBook, &lt;em&gt;now is the time to get one&lt;/em&gt;. The
base line 13&amp;quot; Aluminum Pro model is only $1100 right now –&amp;nbsp;cheaper
than most of the refurbished polycarbonates with lower specs.
Anyway, I'll post lists of my software choices (including TextMate
Plugins and Bundles) soon for those interested. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

Whoot. Here's
the official release: &amp;gt; As part of the Django 1.1 release process,
tonight we've released &amp;gt; Django 1.1 release candidate 1, a
preview/testing package which, &amp;gt; hopefully, is quite close to what
will constitute the final Django &amp;gt; 1.1 release. As with all
pre-release packages, this is not for &amp;gt; production use, but if
you'd like to try out some of the new &amp;gt; goodies coming in 1.1, or
if you'd like to pitch in and help us fix &amp;gt; bugs before the final
1.1 release (due in approximately one week), &amp;gt; feel free to grab a
copy and give it a spin. You can get a copy of &amp;gt; the 1.1 RC from
our downloads page, and we recommend you read the &amp;gt; release notes.
Also, for the security conscious, signed MD5 and &amp;gt; SHA1 checksums
of the 1.1 release candidate package are available. &amp;gt; If no
show-stopping bugs are found, the Django 1.1 final release &amp;gt; will
take place in one week. In the meantime, only critical &amp;gt;
release-blocking bugs will be considered for the final release. &amp;gt;
Django 1.1 is also now in string freeze; strings marked for &amp;gt;
translation will not change between now and the final release, so &amp;gt;
if you have translations to contribute now's the time. With luck, &amp;gt;
we'll see you back here in a week for the release of Django 1.1.&lt;/p&gt;

one thing: Microsoft and.NET. This is not stuff that I wanted to

do me? I could do it, but it would only be for the money. I love
working with software of all kinds, but the development I was doing
did not sharpen my skills in any way. So, I decided that the longer

He's been applying for a job at Old Navy and Target. Why? He just
spent over $20,000 for a year and a half of top-knotch schooling in
his desired field! You'd think he'd at least apply for an

&lt;p&gt;For me, going to college was more about getting out of the house

I learned a lot. I found my passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other students worked their butts off trying to take as many

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of Available Resources / Documentation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large Standard Library&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speed of Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to Read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Community of Developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Easy to read. You'd really be surprised how much this helps a
developer. Well over half the time a C++ Developer spends writing
code is actually time spent deciphering what he's already written.
Certainly the amount of time spent doing this decreases over time,
but even if you've been reading C++ for 20+ years, there still is
and always will be a lot of junk in the middle that subconsciously
slows you down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution?&lt;/strong&gt; Whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whitespace is fantastic. It's standard practice to use indenting
all over the place. Why not use that as block delimiters? We do it
anyway. Lets get rid of Curly Braces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a clip of C#. No shortcuts taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
String output = new String();
output = &amp;quot;Hello, World!&amp;quot;;
try {
    System.Console.WriteLine(output);
}
catch (Exception e) {
    raise;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the same clip of code in Python:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
output = &amp;quot;Hello, world!&amp;quot;

has been a buzz word for the past year and half or so. Being able
to access anything from anywhere? Awesome, but
&lt;em&gt;I can do that now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really get it why everyone's like &amp;quot;oh this will totally
change computing as we know it&amp;quot;. I beg to differ. Perhaps it will
change the way we develop, or organize. But not how Desktops sell.
Or eliminate the need for desktop software. The desktop is not
going to die. Not from Azure, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon has EC2, Microsoft has Azure, and Google has AppEngine.
These are fantastic tools, &lt;em&gt;but they are nothing new –&lt;/em&gt; Just
something someone else thought up, executed properly – followed
through and improved upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates came up with the idea of a true Software Company. This
was revolutionary. Apple took Bill's model, and innovated. They
improved upon it. And look at what's happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really doubt that Google's new OS is going to bring us anything
we don't have already. I do think, however, that
&lt;em&gt;it will build on things we already have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Chrome came out, it didn't offer anything that we didn't
already have. Sure it's a fantastic browser, and I don't want to
discount that. But the ability to run &amp;quot;web apps&amp;quot; as applications is
nothing new. I had been using
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/"&gt;Mozilla's Prism&lt;/a&gt; for at
least a year before Chrome was announced. And on OSX I had been
using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fluidapp.com/"&gt;FluidApp&lt;/a&gt;, which is like Prism on
Crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It seems like the smart thing to do in the tech world nowadays is
to follow through with great ideas – even if they aren't yours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla's team came up with the idea of running web apps at
application with SSB's (single site browsers), but implementation
of Prism was slow, and incredibly buggy. They didn't follow
through. Google did. and Google won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I don't need to come up with a revolutionary idea. Maybe I
just need to be innovative.&lt;/p&gt;

Phenomenal. After using the service for a while, I realized that
they allow you to name an S3 bucket a domain name, and if the DNS

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/"&gt;Amazon EC2&lt;/a&gt;. All I can say is about
this is this is every Hacker's dream come true. I mean seriously. I
can instantly command 500 Xeon-powered linux machines to do
whatever I like for an hour, and then suddenly have them all
disappear off the grid and it will cost me a total of about $10.
Seriously. Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
All excuses are now gone. The possibilities are &lt;strong&gt;limitless&lt;/strong&gt;. Why
aren't more people taking advantage of this wonderful service?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then was introduced to their Affiliate program. If you provide a
link to an Amazon.com sales listing, and someone purchases
something from your link, you will receive a percentage of that
sale. Genius! Screw using Google Adwords, this is a great idea. I
did a few tests on Twitter. I posted one link, and within about 15
minutes, I had over 100 clicks to the Amazon listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty surprised at what i've read recently, however.
Apparently Amazon doesn't want you to use their affiliate links on
mobile devices? What a missed opportunity. I wonder why this is? It
must be some legal issues... I mean, Amazon makes money from
affiliate links - why would they want to limit them?&lt;/p&gt;

OS for various forms of development and end-user work. And just
like every other programmer in the world, I certainly have my
opinions, likes, and dislikes of every platform (some are a lot
closer to perfection than others of course). Text editors are the
same way. Everyone loves one or two, and hates all the others.
There are others of course: I actually know a guy who edits his
live &amp;quot;enterprise-level php applications&amp;quot; with Pico. And he says he
has been for 10 years (Note that Pico has only been out for 9
years). What a joke. &amp;gt; Pico is not a programmer's tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway: For literally decades, there has been a great war
between unix developers.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war"&gt;VI(m) vs. Emacs&lt;/a&gt;. I am
most certainly a proponent of VI, and probably always will be. It's
a fantastic editor, and it suits my needs pefectly. And for those
of us who need something a little more streamlines there's always
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cream.sourceforge.net/"&gt;CREAM&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fantastic
implementation of a heavily customized GVIM that can handle
literally anything you throw at it with little or no fuss. Now all
software, in any context, is a tool. Nothing more. VI and EMACS and
all others exist for one reason: to make a programmer's life
easier. That's why they were invented, and that's why they are
maintained. Now, I still use VIM all the time in my day-to-day
life. Its wonderful to SSH into just about any *nix server on the
planet, and have VIM sitting there, waiting for me to tell it what
to do. It helps me to feel at home. I used to use it full-time for
all of my coding on my workstations as well. I was passionate about
it. I'd tote VIM all the time. VIM is great. It seemed so. It used
to. &lt;a href="#id1"&gt;&lt;span class="problematic" id="id2"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;image|Used to. And then there was TextMate. TextMate.
TextMate. Have a mac?

care. &lt;strong&gt;Your life will never be the same.&lt;/strong&gt; TextMate is seriously
the best piece of software I have come across in a very very long
time. I can code incredibly fast with it. It helps me to become a
better programmer. We all agree that you should NEVER Copy and
Paste code: but using code snippets is different. It's like... An
experience I cannot describe. I'll be purchasing a new laptop soon,
and to be honest with you, the fact that I'll have TextMate on a
mac makes me sure without a doubt to get an Apple computer. That
and the fact that Mac OS X is a FANTASTIC operating system) &amp;gt;
TextMate is a text editor like no other.&lt;/p&gt;

Inline substitution_reference start-string without end-string.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's nothing better. And there never will. I know that's quite
an extreme statement, but it's true. I'll do a full review
eventually. I'm just so blown away. Sorry for my thoughts being all

flaw prevalent in all of today's commercial operating systems. This
is not a security hole, nor is it a CPU-capping bug. It's more of a
world-view. We're simply looking at things the wrong way.
&lt;strong&gt;What ever happened to the days when a computer was a *tool*, rather than an *experience*?&lt;/strong&gt;
Nowadays, computers are viewed by the public as a way of expressing
oneself. Don't get me wrong, a computer can be all of that and
more. Certainly, I find a level of solace and self-identity in my
software/hardware setup. But, a computer, more primarily, is so
much more than that. A computer, in today's modern consumerist
mindset, is a box that runs applications that are made by other
people. You will use the applications either because you think it
will enhance your quality of life, make you more productive, cure
you from boredom, or just be plain &lt;em&gt;neat&lt;/em&gt;. No other options exist,
just the software that big-name companies produce. Sure, this
method does sell well and, in the scheme of things, makes a company
a large amount of money in a short amount of time (which is the
point of a business, is it not?), but perhaps those big-name
companies should think a little more long-term for the sake of us
all. What does this method truly accomplish? It makes people buy
lots of computers that have power way beyond practicality. This, in
term, makes software development freeze. In case you haven't
noticed, we can't do much with computers nowadays that we couldn't
do 10 years ago, except perhaps check our bank accounts online, and
that's hardly a major breakthrough rather than an new-found
application to keep everyone's interest. It self-destructs in the
end when you think about it. And this, my friends, is the central
heart of our problem. In our &amp;quot;ever-changing&amp;quot; world of computer
software, there is little to be found that is truly new or
exciting. We have a bad habit of putting a new face on an old
concept and calling it by a different name, when, in reality, we've
run out of good ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

well was thought up by someone else. The first instance was a game
that me and my friend &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/mikeXocon/"&gt;&amp;#64;MikeXocon&lt;/a&gt;
came up with. After reading up on some man laws one day back at
college, we thought of the idea of making a game where the player
needs to strategically pick the correct urinal to use (men will
understand). It was decided that we would work on it this summer.
We were really serious. I almost bought the domain name.
Well, you can see a screenshot below of one of the top apps on the
AppStore now. Epic fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second idea I had was creating a site that allows you to
prebuffer and schedule tweets. All the time I log on to Twitter and
post 5-10 things right in a row, which is just annoying. There's
not other solution though. If I don't tweet immediately, I won't
remember. So, I was going to make a site that would allow you to do
just that, API and all. Well,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/collegeman"&gt;&amp;#64;collegeman&lt;/a&gt; sent me a link today
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hootsuite.com"&gt;HootSuite&lt;/a&gt;, a Twitter client on crack
that offers a large array of features, including the ability to
have pending tweets. Yay.
I'm upset or anything of course. Its pretty cool that I came up
with these ideas, and someone else did as well. Next time I'll have
to jump the shark I suppose!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/blog/if-textmate-42/"&gt;TextMate&lt;/a&gt;. In my
opinion, it is by far the greatest text editor ever conceived by
mankind. It has a couple of shortcomings, however. One of which is
that it has no built-in FTP or SFTP support. Remote file editing is
a bit of a bear here if you like to view folders in the project
drawer on the side. &lt;img alt="image" src="http://media.kennethreitz.com/images/textmate-logo.png" /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Options for remote editing with TextMate:&lt;/strong&gt; - Cyberduck FTP
client - MacFUSE + SSHFS - Rsync + SSH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cyberduck"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cyberduck&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The `Cyberduck &amp;lt;http://david.olrik.dk/files/Synchronize_remote_directory_rsync_ssh.zip&amp;gt;`_ option is very very useful. While in the FTP client, you simply click &amp;quot;Edit in TextMate&amp;quot; and the client will download the file for you, open it in your editor, and – here's the awesome part – it automatically uploads the file every time you save it. This works great when working with one file at a time. The drawback, however, is when working with large projects. Toggling between many files can be an albatross without the project drawer (cyberduck understandably doesn't allow you to edit an entier folder), so MacFUSE is the next logical choice.&lt;/strong&gt;
## MacFUSE + SSHFS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pqrs.org/tekezo/macosx/sshfs/"&gt;MacFUSE&lt;/a&gt; + SSHFS works
great, and allows you to mount an SSH folder as a mountpoint on
your local system. VERY USEFUL. You can open this folder with
TextMate. This is perfect for smaller projects. However, with
larger projects, this makes opening the folder in TextMate almost
unbearable as it checks the status of every single file. Too slow
:P ## Rsync + SSH&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here's the final solution: Rsync + SSH. This allows me to automatically sync my working copy with my server and allow for snappy file interactions without having insane latencies for starting up and bandwidth hogging!&lt;/strong&gt;
To remotely sync over SSH, run the following code: rsync -avz -e
ssh &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:remoteuser&amp;#64;remotehost"&gt;remoteuser&amp;#64;remotehost&lt;/a&gt;:/remote/dir /target/dir/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hint&lt;/strong&gt;: If your remote working copy is a subverson checkout, you
can add --cvs-exclude&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="system-message"&gt;
&lt;p class="system-message-title"&gt;System Message: WARNING/2 (&lt;tt class="docutils"&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, line 2); &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="#id1"&gt;backlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Duplicate explicit target name: &amp;quot;textmate&amp;quot;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into the rsync parameters, and it will exclude the &amp;quot;.svn&amp;quot; folders!
You can then open this directory in TextMate and make all the
changes you want, and then sync after ! There is also a wonderful
TextMate Bundle for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://david.olrik.dk/files/Synchronize_remote_directory_rsync_ssh.zip"&gt;Remote Rsync + SSH within TextMate&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://technorati.com/tag/Development"&gt;Development&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://technorati.com/tag/OSX"&gt;OSX&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://technorati.com/tag/rsync"&gt;rsync&lt;/a&gt;,

I've crossed over. To .NET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will continue to be a complete open-source junkie of course, but
during the work hours, I will no longer be working with PHP and
Python. I will now be working with .NET and SharePoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was presented with a rather good reason for this actually:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Using SharePoint gives our clients a tremendous amount of security
– they can trust that if, for whatever reason, something were to
happen to us, their software could still be serviced by someone
else.&amp;quot; That's certainly justifiable and understandable. That's a
pretty good idea actually. I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking into ASP.NET, I was actually quite surprised. The
code is a lot cleaner than PHP. It looks rather powerful actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, that's why I've crossed over. No hard feelings :)&lt;/p&gt;

Release Candidate, I have done a bit of reading on the subject. In
my research, I have made the following observances&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vista was truly the worst operating system I have ever used in my
life. It had some wonderful features, but everything was tied
together so inefficiently It could bring the fastest computer
around to its knees. I have used Vista on a rather powerful quad
core system with over 4 GB of RAM, and it still responded poorly.
There were a few things in Vista that were wonderful ideas, but
executed horribly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated Search and Indexing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ReadyBoost for superior caching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows XP Compatibility Mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application Pre-Caching based on Observed User Activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bending over backwards for old API compatibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 looks promising, however. Take a look at the list of new
improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transparent Windows XP Virtualization Compatibility Layer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsiveness existent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced Window Management Abilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New Version of ReadyBoost&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated ClearType Tuning (about time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature-Packed Application Bar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 is what Vista was supposed to be from what I understand.
I'm keeping my fingers crossed, but I do look forward to this new
Operating System. I sincerely hope that it truly is a great
improvement. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;

Science or equivalent experience&amp;quot; requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my studies in Computer Science at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kennnethreitsz.com/was-college-worth-it/"&gt;George Mason University&lt;/a&gt;,
though short, I learned a number of things. One of them was what a
waste it was to learn such higher math in my field. I want to
develop software, not develop the most cunning-edge
earth-shattering algorithms. I don't want to reinvent ssh or find a
better way to implement pgp keys. Of course, those things are
necessary in certain fields, but not in mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was taught that Programming is to Computer Science as a Telescope
is to Astronomy. Its a tool to get to a means. If this is true,
than why wasn't I thought how to make software?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Software Developers also have degrees in Electrical
Engineering. Why is this? A CS degree doesn't seem to quite fit
either. Perhaps we should make a separate degree for Software
Development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Science should be separated from Software Development.
They should be two different Degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I realized this, I started spending my time focusing on design
rather than math. I learned a great deal of things from color
theory to relational spacing and I found myself a new home: web
design. It's a beautiful field. I started to spend my own time
learning software development, rather than spending hours studying
Calc 2.&lt;/p&gt;

networks on the web today: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://facebook.com"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/kennethreitz"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is an information-streaming application that is used by
people in all walks of life. It functions, sometimes in roundabout
ways, as an instant messenger, email client, alert system, and
social networking connectivity tool. It also offers fantastic,
powerful searching and heavily encourages all-in-all openness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, when I was introduced to it, was an application that
allowed users to create a simple page with information about
themselves, and connected them with people they knew in real life.
Users could send messages to one another, both privately and
publicly, post links, and upload an unlimited number of photos. Or
at least it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Facebook revamped their interface and introduced a
reinforced concept of status updates being a &amp;quot;life-stream&amp;quot; rather
than a &amp;quot;summary of my week&amp;quot;. Much emphasis is placed on what is
going on &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, not what happened yesterday. This is great in
my opinion – however, it totally changes what Facebook is for me.
Prior to the change, when adding a friend, much emphasis was placed
on adding relationship details for all of your friends. If you
didn't know someone, Facebook wouldn't even allow you to keep them
as a friend. Now, Facebook auto-suggest people that it thinks you
might know, and encourages the meeting of people through Facebook
itself. Nothing wrong with that of course... I'm just showing how
it has been changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a fundamental difference here:
&lt;strong&gt;Twitter changes with its users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It changes according to the trends of it's users. Twitter does
absolutely nothing to influence they way its users use its
services. In fact, it evolves &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; them. For example, Twitter
allowed users to view when people &amp;#64;replied to their tweets by going
to the &amp;#64;replies section of the user interface. In this section, you
could see a list of all the latest tweets that started with
&lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&amp;#64;yourtwittername"&gt;'&amp;#64;yourtwittername&lt;/a&gt;' and see what people had to say to you. After a
while, users started adding &amp;#64;replies everywhere in tweets, not just
the beginning. So, twitter changed the algorithm, and now you can
see when &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:'&amp;#64;yourtwittername"&gt;'&amp;#64;yourtwittername&lt;/a&gt;' is mentioned anywhere in a tweet.
Genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook tries to change its users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time you heard a bunch of Twitter users complain
about a newly implimented feature? and when was the last time you
heard a Facebook user complain of a new feature or interface
change?
Yes, they complain constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what is Facebook's purpose? To deliver useful content and
introduce you to new people (while delivering ads), or providing a
nice platform for friends to connect with eachother? If you ask me,
Facebook's intended purpose is becoming less and less clear the
longer that I use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

student) is a fantastic environment for a student in their 20's.
Never before have I felt so &lt;em&gt;enabled&lt;/em&gt;. The campus allowed me to
have a completely restriction-free place to live with peers of my
own age, and millions of resources an average American could only
dream of having free access to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olympic-sized swimming pool minutes away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every restaurant under the sun within walking distance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free Kitchens and items promoting every brand under the sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't go to stores – they come to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Free food. Alot of it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Functions and for everything under the sun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seminars from the Brightest Minds in Computer Science&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Professors willing to go the extra mile for you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dozens of cultures fused into one working student-body&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An incredibly Culturally-Diverse Campus (taco bell and Islamic
meditation lounge in the same building)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the things that I miss. I crave the &amp;quot;college experience&amp;quot;
so much, but that makes me realize something: I didn't go to
college for an education – I went there to get away. And I did so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed. I had my heart broken (ish). I got into trouble. I
reached out to the needy and regretted it. I worked for notable
causes. I got a job. I strayed from truth. I got severely addicted
to Caffeine. I was forgiven. I slept in. I researched. I learned to
discern from someone who's worth my time and someone who's not. I
learned to prioritize. Lateralus. I wasted people's time. I was
used. I experimented. I fell asleep every morning during an
all-you-can-eat breakfast fit for a king. I relieved my childhood.
I saw others lives fall apart. I learned to drive. I went way too
fast. I forgot to prioritize. I found the most breathtaking music
on earth. I made mistakes. I connected. I had a fantastic night. I
played live shows. I was shot down. I failed miserably at Ju Jit
Su. I was accused of Harrassment–I was totally innocent. I had the
worst sleeping schedule on earth. I didn't try Salvia. I saw the
best movies. I met the most amazing people. I shook Bill Clinton's
hand. I got first-hand internet experience I couldn't have dreamed
of having before. I found my true passions. I learned without being
taught. I saw some funny videos. I made some awesome friends. I
lost some too. I joined a riot. I learned that I do way too many
things at once. I lost a job. I learned to sell myself. I learned
how to present myself. And, most importantly,
&lt;em&gt;I learned what was truly important in life&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here I stand, $10,000 dollars in debt with a GPA of 1.14 and 8
credit hours – and I've never been happier. That was a $10K well
spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
And I have never been happier.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Reitz&lt;/p&gt;

How?
Let me explain. While I am a firm believer that cloud computing
should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; be viewed as a replacement for the current desktop/
model, I must say that I am now a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; fan of storing my data
on the internet. Not all of my data, keep in mind, but information
that needs to be accessed by multiple computers, of course – but
that goes without saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always had the problem of not being able to keep track of
all my data. I switch computers and operating systems so often, I
can't keep track of my contacts at all. And when I update one, I
have to go through and update many different databases – not the
most efficient method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the ultimate solution is – obviously – to consolidate all of my
contacts into one database. I used to keep all of my contacts on my
Samsung Blackjack cellphone. This worked well, since I could easily
sync it with a computer. This caused a problem, however: I could
only sync it with one system. If I was at work or on another
system, I had no way to get to my friend's email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Google Contacts started to support Exchange Syncing,
which happens to work &lt;em&gt;flawlessly&lt;/em&gt; with my Windows Mobile 6.1
install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My life will never be the same. Thank you, Google. I am eternally
grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

for a specific pattern? Patterns like “one capital letter followed
by three numbers” or “dd/mm/yyyy”? This is known as Pattern
Matching. Regular Expressions allow easy syntax for pattern
matching, and is an invaluable skill to add to one’s toolkit, no
matter what your area of expertise/practice is. Whether you’re
writing a Compiler, Form Validator, Text Editor, Django Project, or
Language Translator, Regular Expressions will always prove to be
invaluable. Here is a very basic overview of some syntax: ‘\d’
represents a digit. ‘\s’ represents whitespace. ‘.’ represents any
character. If you have worked with Python for very long, you are
probably already familiar with the concept. Take a look at the
following code: print(“Rounded = %05d” % (42))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes sure that the digit printed has 5 digits, and will
automatically add 0’s to compensate. If you understand this
concept, then you shouldn’t have a problem. Perl-style Regular
Expressions are a very widely-accepted implementation, and Python
has built in support for this mini-language! It’s easily
accessible, so let’s get started. The included ‘re’ module will
give us everything we need to get started: import re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets give our new module a try! It will enable you to do anything
you could ever want with regular expressions. Here’s a quick
example of some basic use. import re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
string0 = 'Kenneth Reitz is a cool guy!'
regExp = r’kenneth[- ]?reitz’

if re.match(regExp, string0, re.IGNORECASE):
   print “True”
else:
   print “False”
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This script takes the string ‘Kenneth Reitz is a cool guy’, and
searches for ‘kenneth reitz’ inside of it. If ‘kenneth reitz’ is
found within string0 (re.match compares the expression with the
string), the script will print “True”, if not, it will print
“False”. Additional parameters can be passed to the re.match
function when needed. Note the ‘re.IGNORECASE’ flag used here –
This tells the function be case-insensitive. Once you master the
regular expression syntax, you’ll realize how truly powerful they
can be. The options become limitless and the usefulness becomes
undeniable. Here’s another example: import re&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
string0 = '10.03.1988'
regExp = r'^\d\d[./]\d\d[./]\d\d\d\d?$'

if re.match(regExp, string0):
   print 'True'
else:
   print 'False/
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When run, this script prints out “True”. If we were to change
string0 to ‘10.03.88’, it would print “False”. Simple, isn’t it?
Now, while a True/False return could be useful in certain
applications (i.e. form validation), most of the time, we’re going
to want to have a bit more information in order for our checks to
be useful. We can tell Python to show us the data that matches our
query. To do this, we’re going to have to break our expression up
into different groups. In the date we have defined, there are three
obvious groups we could separate this into: the day, month, and
year. While defining a Regular Expression, you can use parentheses
‘()’ to define groups: regExp = r’^()././$’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This separates our expression into 3 separate groups. Python also
supports turning a Regular Expression string into an
heavily-supported object with the re.compile() function. Once you
define a string as a Regular Expression object, you can use the
built in methods to preform powerful parsing. Now we can ask python
what is in those groups: import restring0 = ‘10.03.1988’ regExp =
re.compile(‘^()././$’) regExpMatches = regExp.match(string0)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
if re.match(regExp, string0):
   print(“Day: %s\nMonth: %s\nYear: %s” % (regExpMatches.group(1), \
     regExpMatches.group(2), regExpMatches.group(3)))
else:
   print(“Invalid Date.”)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When executed, this script parses through our validated date,
breaks it down into groups, and prints the following: &amp;gt; Day: 10 &amp;gt;
Month: 03 &amp;gt; Year: 1988&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The possibilities are limitless! Here’s a quick run-down of the re
module’s functions, strait from the Python documentation for
reference: match: Match a regular expression pattern to the
beginning of a string. search: Search a string for the presence of
a pattern. sub: Substitute occurrences of a pattern found in a
string subn: Same as sub, but also return the number of
substitutions made. split: Split a string by the occurrences of a
pattern. findall: Find all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
compile: Compile a pattern into a RegexObject. purge: Clear the
regular expression cache. escape: Backslash all non-alphanumerics
in a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, you can always type help(re) (after importing the re
module) into the Python interpret to take a quick look at the
module’s built-in documentation. Good luck and happy coding!&lt;/p&gt;

installation of Microsoft's Office 2007 Suite to run on your Ubuntu
Linux Distribution? For some people, this is the only thing that
truly holds them back from an all-Linux environment... But not
anymore! We have compiled a nice, concise set of instructions to
help guide you along. ### Install Wine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WINE (&lt;strong&gt;W**ine **I**s **N**ot an **E**mulator) is an application
layer for Linux that interprets the Windows API and DLLs into
native Linux commands. This allows for programs made for Windows to
be run in Linux! In order to run Office 2007, Wine 1.1.9 (or newer)
is **required.&lt;/strong&gt; It is currently in a development release. If you
don’t have it installed already (this is very likely), go ahead and
type the following commands, which will set it up for you: wget -q
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/387EE263.gpg"&gt;http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/387EE263.gpg&lt;/a&gt; -O- | sudo
apt-key add -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sudo wget http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/sources.list.d/intrepid.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install wine cabextract
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE&lt;/strong&gt;:
&lt;em&gt;On non-Debian based systems, this will not work. Please refer to&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb"&gt;*this site*&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;em&gt;for installation instructions.&lt;/em&gt; You should now have an
installation of Wine 1.1.9 installed on your system. To confirm the
version of Wine installed, type the following: wine --version&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="install-winetricks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install winetricks:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks"&gt;Winetricks&lt;/a&gt; is a small SH
script which will go on the internet and automatically fetch and
install Microsoft DLLs and Libraries into Wine with almost no
hassle at all! To download it directly, type the following
commands: wget &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks"&gt;http://www.kegel.com/wine/winetricks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
chmod +x ./winetricks
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="utilize-winetricks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Utilize winetricks:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will setup all necessary libraries and DLLs that Office 2007
will need to run properly: ./winetricks gdiplus riched20 riched30
msxml3 msxml4 msxml6 corefonts tahoma vb6run vcrun6 msi2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be patient while the downloads complete. This script is
working hard and is saving hours of your time. ### Insert Office
2007 Disk and Run Setup!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have all of the DLLs necessary to run the Installer,
let us do so! wine pathToCD/setup.exe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here on out, you should be good to go! The installer should
run and install everything just as if it was a Windows system! If
you have any problems, ask, and we'll try to help you out as much
as possible! UPDATE: Lost your CD?
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.programmerfish.com/free-direct-download-microsoft-office-2007"&gt;Download the installer&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To the George Mason University Community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a year now the global financial situation has steadily
worsened, and many aspects of life have become more difficult for
many Americans. There is little evidence that the world or national
economies are rebounding or showing signs of an imminent recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We share the hope that was so profoundly expressed by President
Obama during his inaugural speech of a better day in the months and
years ahead, and his resolve to view this financial situation as an
opportunity for improvement. How long the economic crisis will
persist is unknown to any of us. The road ahead will not be easy,
but if we keep our focus and reaffirm our commitment to protect the
core, we will endure and be well positioned when the economy
rebounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our institutional vital signs are stronger than ever as we have
assembled a teaching and research faculty who continuously advance
the reputation of the institution. We have achieved national
recognition for our teaching excellence, as well as several
breakthrough discoveries in various areas of research. The number
of student applications is higher than ever, and the quality of
incoming undergraduate, transfer, and graduate students is superior
to any previous year. Our retention rate and graduation rate are at
all-time highs. We award more degrees annually than any other
college or university in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and our
alumni are increasingly being tapped as highly respected regional,
national, and international leaders. National publications have
acknowledged our institutional advancement and our outstanding
value to our students. These rankings and accomplishments are a
direct reflection of the effort and commitment made by you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are currently expending approximately $250 million per year
on new construction and improvements, we are not only changing the
face of our campuses but serving as a major contributor to the
Northern Virginia economy at a time when so many other economic
drivers are either stagnant or declining. By any measurement, we
are highly efficient and effective in how we manage the university,
and this is true of both our academic administration and our
support services. However, as state support declines and day-to-day
responsibilities increase, certainly you must question how we can
possibly do more. Yet we know we must. We must continue to find
ways to work smarter and more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provost and senior vice president have held informational
sessions to explain our budget reduction strategies as we have
absorbed a 5 percent General Fund reduction in FY 2008; another 7
percent budget reduction in FY 2009 with the high probability of a
deeper cut in state support next year (FY 2010). As you probably
know, the governor recommended another 8 percent General Fund
reduction for FY 2010. Operating plans for FY 2010 are currently
being developed which will provide us with the necessary
information to make the wisest possible resource allocation
decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the state continues to struggle financially, we must focus our
efforts on keeping higher education accessible to new and returning
students. This will be a monumental task as we brace ourselves for
what will most likely be a substantial reduction in state support
this coming year. Therefore, I have decided to establish an Adverse
Economy Assistance Fund to assist students whose family’s economic
situation has been dramatically weakened by job loss or other
catastrophic incidents as a result of the economic crisis.
Established at $150,000 and to be used by the Office of Financial
Aid in conjunction with other available assistance to help
students, this fund will hopefully make the difference between
either continuing their studies or withdrawing from George Mason
University for many students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The university’s endowment performance for the past year, though
experiencing a double-digit decline, achieved a top quartile peer
ranking. A priority for Mason is to continue to build on the
success of the recently completed capital campaign that raised more
than $140 million for George Mason University. In 2008 we raised
more dollars, gifts, and pledges than ever in the history of Mason.
We are enormously grateful to the thousands of Mason supporters who
continue to invest in the future of this great institution. Your
support is more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our university culture is marked by a commitment to improvement, a
relentless search for best practices, and a quest for excellence.
We know that only through the alignment of a shared vision and a
university spirit that embraces diversity and civility can we
advance those actions that will strengthen the core values of this
great university. There is no easy answer to maintaining
institutional momentum during difficult financial times, but being
resilient and optimistic is the foundation of our plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our strength is our people. Several university community members
have already made significant contributions by volunteering to
accept salary reductions, deferring compensation package increases,
individually absorbing costs that otherwise would be eligible for
state reimbursement, and contributing larger amounts of
unrestricted donations to the George Mason University Foundation. A
different person seems to step up every day to lead us on this
journey. That is what makes George Mason University so special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will emerge a better university after these turbulent times
because each of you believes that you can make a difference at
Mason—and you can—and you do. Although challenged by these
financial constraints, we will rally together to build an
institution that will withstand today’s economic downturn and be
prepared to meet any future challenges. It is our responsibility,
our opportunity, to take advantage of this economic downturn and do
whatever we can to lift tomorrow’s leaders onto our shoulders so
they may view a horizon that inspires hope and promise and the
opportunity to fulfill their dreams of a better tomorrow. We in
higher education hold the key to their success. Together we can do
this! We are Mason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan G. Merten&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

so-called &amp;quot;micro-blogging&amp;quot; scene. Is this a bad thing? A number
people think that
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.neuro-vision.us/ad/Article/How-Twitter-is-Destroying-Your-Mind/4970"&gt;Twitter is destroying us&lt;/a&gt;.
Others seem to find it to be a wonderful
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2263342_market-business-twitter.html"&gt;marketplace&lt;/a&gt;
and even a source for
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.whatsyourtweetworth.com/"&gt;revenue&lt;/a&gt;, if allowed. In
order for any of these things to come to realization though,
Twitter must make some serious decisions. And fast. The initial
idea is to value a twitterer's rank based upon the number of
followers a user has. This seems like a good, strong idea for a
while, but when you look a little deeper under the skin, it's
apparent that this is not a good system. Most users send an update
every so often about themselves, their lives, and their homes. What
worth is that? Yes, a message would be delivered to a larger number
of people, but the relevancy of the people being reached would be
very low. However, if one was to write a quality tweet that is
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/29/its-not-how-many-followers-you-have-that-counts-its-how-many-times-you-get-retweeted/"&gt;re-tweeted over and over again&lt;/a&gt;,
that user will reach an even larger group of people, either
directly or in-directly, and the relevancy of the users reached
would be much, much greater. The more people who reTweet what you
have to say not only reach more users than meaningless-tweeters,
but the people who would take the time to listen to what you have
to say would be immensely more common. More relevant readers mean
more clicks, which mean more visits to linked sites, which means
more revenue for a company and even more potential customers. What
do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

I wish I
would have known then.* As I've said before, I find many reasons
to believe that modern commercialized software platforms are
severely lacking in many, many areas. This should not come as a
surprise to anyone. Perhaps basic utility-inclusion is not the only
solution though. Perhaps the basic priority structure and ethics
that development and marketing teams utilize should be forced into
question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, most major computer software corporations, are, all in
all, trying to make money. No matter how hard you try to find a way
around this, or justify why these companies try to do the things
that they do, the only answer is money. These companies are simply
trying to make a quick buck. This concept has worked incredibly
well for years, but we seem to have a bit of a problem with
foresight. After a while, people get rather bored with the same old
concepts being presented to them in new and exciting ways. This is
why Microsoft needs to release a new operating system every once in
a while. Microsoft's current problem is that the masses are
beginning to realize their other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So here's my proposal for the long-term design and marketing strategy 2.0:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An operating system should first be a place of power, consistency,
stability, scalability, and flexibility. Included would be a robust
and fully scriptable toolset which can be manipulated and presented
both graphically and statistically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the user interface should be very well thought out and
planned, with ample room for improvement down the road. Its purpose
should first be a place of usability, workflow, and creativity.
Task-related workflow and presentation customization, accessible to
all types of users, is crucial to the success of the UI. Second,
the User Interface should be a mode of personal expression and
aesthetic preference. This should never take precedence over the
overall stability, usability, or general usefulness of a desktop
system, for any given reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the user application platform system needs to be designed.
A centralized repository of applications is an incredibly efficient
method for application distribution. This repository would be a
dynamic, centralized database of application software and packages
that are intended for different groups of people. Most major Linux
distributions use this heavily, as well as Apple for it's iPod and
iPhone applications, and it has been proven to work well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any of these rules should have the ability to be broken easily by
advanced power users for technical reasons/needs. This should be in
no way advertised or demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone up for the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;

just released a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="%20http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/36704"&gt;Code Challenge&lt;/a&gt;
for hackers around the world! Here are the details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A relatively basic form of substitution cipher is the Caesar
Cipher, named for its Roman origins. The Caesar Cipher involves
writing two alphabets, one above the other. The lower alphabet is
shifted by one or more characters to the right or left and is used
as the cipher text to represent the plain text letter in the
alphabet above it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain Text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cipher Text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this example, the plain text K is enciphered with the cipher
text L. The phrase 'Lucky Dog' would be enciphered as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain Text: L U C K Y D O G&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cipher Text: M V D L Z E P H&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ciphers can be made more secure by using a keyword to scramble one
of the alphabets. Keywords can be placed in the plain text, the
cipher text, or both, and any word can be used as a key if repeated
letters are dropped. Here the word SECRETLY (minus the second E) is
used as the plain text keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plain Text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S E C R T L Y A B D F G H I J K M N O P Q U V W X Z&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cipher Text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FBI of course doesn't always invite folks to break code on its
site. In fact last spring a consultant managed to access the
bureau's National Crime Information Center database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this a ploy to get the hacker community back to its roots? Most
certainly we seem to loose touch to what this is all about. Or
perhaps just an elaborate way to recruit future employees due to
the inability to advertise for positions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;
