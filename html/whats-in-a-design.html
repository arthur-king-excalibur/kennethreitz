        <p>Disclaimer: I am <strong>not</strong> an Apple fanboy. Apple makes a fortune off
of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.squidoo.com/sheeple">speeple</a>. An Apple FanBoy
blindly follows everything the cult leader, Steve Jobs has to say.
They go out and purchase every iProduct that Apple realeases and
does so with a smile on their face, not realizing that over the
course of four years, they have
<a class="reference external" href="http://calacanis.com/2009/08/08/the-case-against-apple-in-five-parts/">spent about $20,000</a>
on Apple products alone. They leak photos of an upcoming product
with incredibly low resolution so the masses can pick and decipher
the image, spending countless hours just trying to imagine what
that mysterious new button does. And people do it! They completely
take advantage, but rightfully so. Who could blame them? They are,
after all, a business. It would be foolish for them not to, because
that FanBoy pays thousands of dollars to watch a 3 hour long
commercial, and they love it! They love OSX for no apparent reason
other than they are told to. They go out and buy every single new
iPhone the day that it comes out, when there's clearly nothing
wrong with the one they had. Year after year, they pour more and
more money into their investment in nothing more than a brand that
they thing will change who they are as a person. They want to be
Steve Jobs. They write endless posts about how much money they
spend on Apple products every month, and just can't wait to get
their hands on the next one. This is not that post and I am not
that guy. <img alt="image" src="http://pcmacsmackdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/apple-logo1.jpg" /> I do, however, believe that my recently purchased
<a class="reference external" href="http://kennethreitz.com/blog/i-finally-got-a-macbook/">13&quot; Unibody MacBook Pro is the greatest laptop ever manufactured</a>
on Earth to date. But not because Apple made it. That's irrelevant.
Now please, don't get me wrong: I love Apple. And that's because,
they have a <strong>superior</strong> operating system and they put an
extraordinary amount of design and thought into every nook and
cranny of every system that they release. This system is designed
well. <em>Incredibly</em> well. On a side note, I firmly believe that OSX
is the greatest desktop operating system of all time, and I see no
chance of this changing any time soon. From many different
standpoints (End User, Prosumer, Developer, Newbie) this holds
true. I am a fan and follower of one thing and one thing only:
Design. And, for now, Apple hands-down has the greatest sense of
design, both software and hardware in my opinion. But if something
else comes along made by someone else, I'll be sure to give that a
try with an open mind. :)</p>
