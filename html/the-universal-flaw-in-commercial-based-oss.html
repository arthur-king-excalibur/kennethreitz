        <p>Designers and Developers around the world, I present to you the
flaw prevalent in all of today's commercial operating systems. This
is not a security hole, nor is it a CPU-capping bug. It's more of a
world-view. We're simply looking at things the wrong way.
<strong>What ever happened to the days when a computer was a *tool*, rather than an *experience*?</strong>
Nowadays, computers are viewed by the public as a way of expressing
oneself. Don't get me wrong, a computer can be all of that and
more. Certainly, I find a level of solace and self-identity in my
software/hardware setup. But, a computer, more primarily, is so
much more than that. A computer, in today's modern consumerist
mindset, is a box that runs applications that are made by other
people. You will use the applications either because you think it
will enhance your quality of life, make you more productive, cure
you from boredom, or just be plain <em>neat</em>. No other options exist,
just the software that big-name companies produce. Sure, this
method does sell well and, in the scheme of things, makes a company
a large amount of money in a short amount of time (which is the
point of a business, is it not?), but perhaps those big-name
companies should think a little more long-term for the sake of us
all. What does this method truly accomplish? It makes people buy
lots of computers that have power way beyond practicality. This, in
term, makes software development freeze. In case you haven't
noticed, we can't do much with computers nowadays that we couldn't
do 10 years ago, except perhaps check our bank accounts online, and
that's hardly a major breakthrough rather than an new-found
application to keep everyone's interest. It self-destructs in the
end when you think about it. And this, my friends, is the central
heart of our problem. In our &quot;ever-changing&quot; world of computer
software, there is little to be found that is truly new or
exciting. We have a bad habit of putting a new face on an old
concept and calling it by a different name, when, in reality, we've
run out of good ideas.</p>
