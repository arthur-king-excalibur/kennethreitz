        <p>Dear Borders (and Starbucks subidary Seattle's Best Coffee), You
have a lovely book store. Quite lovely. I love the books you sell.
I love the music you play. I love the coffee you serve. I <strong>love</strong>
the Moleskine Notebooks you sell. Everything about your store
tailors itself perfectly to people like me. You strive to make a
person feel intellectual and important, and that is marketed almost
flawlessly. You seem to have forgotten one key demographic,
however. If a tech-savvy web developer wants to go and play with
his newly-developed web design skills he obtained from books out of
<em>your</em> technology section, he is free to bring his laptop into your
lovely café. Awesome. You even offer power outlets. All the
sweeter. So, he decides to bring his laptop in one day to play with
his newly purchased python web development book. He connects to
your aptly named “Borders” network, and types “<a class="reference external" href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a>”
into his address bar, excited to be connected to his world in such
a convenient location. His face of joy then abruptly changes,
however, when he realizes that he has to fork out SEVEN DOLLARS to
use the network. <strong>Seven Dollars</strong>. You could feed a starving child
in Africa for a WEEK with $7. There is no justification. There is
no excuse. This is downright stupid on your part. Do you have any
idea how much business you are turning down by doing this? If your
stores offered free wifi, chances are, I’d be there three to four
times every week, buying coffee every time, and most likely a book
every other time. That is a LOT of business. And there are many
more people like me. Many more. People like me love your stores. We
love the atmosphere. We love the books. We love the knowledge. We
love the Moleskines. And we also love the internet. Apparently,
more than you know. I understand that you have an agreement with
AT&amp;T, and i’m sure they have wonderful salesman that assure that
you are offering a service to your employees. They are wrong. Very
wrong. I know for a fact that I’d be a customer time and time again
if you offered this service for free. And I’m sure your café and
book sales would go up at least 15%. From what I understand, your
profits are decreasing heavily at the moment. I believe your stock
is currently worth $3.34 a share. Impressive. So what do you have
to lose? In the meantime, I’ll be taking my daily $7 coffee
excursions to Panera, where wifi is free. Kindest Regards, Kenneth
Reitz # Border's Respnse Dear Kenneth, Thank you for contacting
Borders Customer Care regarding Wifi service. We welcome your
comments, as we rely on feedback from customers to improve on the
services and products we provide. Borders stores will be offering
free Wifi service and all of the stores will have it by mid
October. We appreciate your positive comments about Borders stores.
We are always glad to hear from customers, but it is especially
nice when a happy customer takes the time to let us know that
they're enjoying the rewards and services we offer. If you have any
other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.
Sincerely, Kathy Borders Rewards Customer Care ## My Reaction Well,
I didn't see that coming.</p>
